    "## Topic Modeling\n",
    "Topic Modeling automatically discover the hidden themes from given documents. It is an unsupervised text analytics algorithm that is used for finding the group of words from the given document. These group of words represents a topic. There is a possibility that, a single document can associate with multiple themes.\n",

    "## Comparison Between Text Classification and Topic Modeling\n",
    "Text classification is a supervised machine learning problem, where a text document or article classified into a pre-defined set of classes. Topic modeling is the process of discovering groups of co-occurring words in text documents. These group co-occurring related words makes \"topics\". It is a form of unsupervised learning, so the set of possible topics are unknown. Topic modeling can be used to solve the text classification problem. Topic modeling will identify the topics presents in a document\" while text classification classifies the text into a single class.\n",

    "## Use Cases of Topic Modeling\n",
    "Simple applications in which this technique is used are documented clustering in text analysis, recommender systems, and information retrieval. More detailed use-cases of topic modeling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resume Summarization:** It can help recruiters to evaluate resumes by a quick glance. They can reduce effort in filtering pile of resume.<br><br>\n",

    "**Search Engine Optimization:** Online articles, blogs, and documents can be tagged easily by identifying the topics and associated keywords, which can improve optimize search results.<br><br>\n",

      "The 390th blog is it is now easier than ever before to sell your music to a worldwide audience i have been a musician since childhood and while education travel and then working for a living got in the way of my dream of becoming a guitar hero i have never given up hope indeed i have spent the last couple of years writing and recording an eclectic mix of songs the next obvious step was to find some way to get them heard which is where the advent of social media came into its own while myspace is something of a musical backwater these days despite justin timberlake s intervention it is still a place to post one s songs and updates for a musically oriented audience much stronger and with a better sense of community though is i began uploading instrumentals and songs to soundcloud several years ago but then opted for a paid account to get more comprehensive statistics as well as pretty much unlimited space for audio files followers on soundcloud are commonly fellow musicians and as with all the other social networks you get more out of them the more you put in follow others listen to their music and leave comments and more people will reciprocate there is importantly also the option to add buy links to other services through which your listeners audience fans even might pay to download a track or two the first potentially profitable option i came across was it is very similar to soundcloud you can create a profile and start adding your music you can set a price or make it free to download also you can either take all the profits after the site s commission or opt to share with a charity of your choice in my case i give a proportion of every sale to the fender music foundation it may just be my experience but reverbnation seems a lot quieter in terms of community than soundcloud and although i get a steady stream of profile views few people seem to listen there moreover reverbnation messages users quite frequently with offers of music promotion which seem to rely on one having paid for a press pack up front the next site that appeared on my radar was which also lets you upload your songs and artwork and set a price the big advantage is that your fans have the option to show their true devotion and pay more than the asking price if they really like a track or album i have had some success with marketing on bandcamp although again i do not think i am ready to give up the day job just yet of course in the music download world itunes google play amazon mp and spotify are the primary paid outlets and the most well known among legitimate downloaders getting your songs and music album on to these music sites generally requires you to have proper music management and a record label but there are other ways to get listed as well the likes of music distribution platforms like and take an upfront fee and will act as a proxy for a record label to get your music on to itunes and other online music stores your music uploads will appear in stores worldwide these services like also have a partnership with youtube and you are paid a share of the ad revenue whenever your on the other hand charges an almost negligible annual fee does not take a cut of the profits and nevertheless allows you to upload as many songs as you like each year it takes a few days for your tracks to propagate to itunes google amazon spotify deezer and rdio but it is a very slick and simple process in addition there is which is similar to distrokid for getting your songs on to itunes amazon et al quickly and seamlessly but with one important difference it lets you upload and sell cover versions of other people s songs by taking care of the licensing and royalties for the songwriter the service charges no upfront fee but takes a relatively large cut of any profits from the download stores obviously none of these music services will make you a guitar hero if you do not have the musical chops and even if you do you will have to spend a considerable amount of time marketing and sharing the links to see any substantial return when i was a youngster going viral was all about getting spots and feeling ill today i would be very pleased to go viral with spotify and to get a spot on the itunes charts rock on send personalized emails to multiple people with a google sheet download gmail messages and attachments to your google drive extract email addresses from gmail messages and save in a google sheet receive files of any size from anyone in your google drive track prices of your favorite amazon items in a google sheet create smart twitter bots without writing a single line of code we build bespoke solutions that use the capabilities and the features of google apps g suite for automating business processes and driving business productivity our are deployed in some of the biggest companies and universities worldwide with over installations download the to know more india google apps script g suite apis\n"

      "by category by date my first book my friend sancho was published in may and went on to become the biggest selling debut novel released that year in india it is a contemporary love story set in mumbai and had earlier for the man asian literary prize to learn more about the book if you are interested do join for my friend sancho for more about my publisher hachette india my posts on india uncut about my friend sancho can be found this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india back in the last decade i was a cricket journalist for a few years then around years ago i quit i was jaded as hell every game seemed like deja vu nothing new just another round on the treadmill although i would remember her fondly i thought me and cricket were done and then i fell in love again cricket has changed in the last few years in glorious ways there have been new ways of thinking about the game there have been new ways of playing the game every season new kinds of drama form new nuances spring up into sight this is true even of what had once seemed the dullest form of the game one day cricket we are entering into a brave new world and the team leading us there is england no matter what happens in the world cup final today a single game involves a huge amount of luck this england side are extraordinary they are the bridge between eras leading us into a golden age of cricket i know that sounds hyperbolic so let me stun you further by saying that i give the ipl credit for this and now having woken up you up with such a jolt on this lovely sunday morning let me explain twenty cricket changed the game in two fundamental ways both ended up changing one day cricket the first was strategy when the first t games took place teams applied an odi template to innings building pinch hit build slog but this was not an optimal approach in odis teams have players over overs in t s they have players over overs the equation between resources and constraints is different this means that the cost of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball goes up critically it means that the value of aggression rises a team need not follow the odi template in some instances attacking for all overs or as i call it frontloading may be optimal west indies won the t world cup in by doing just this and england played similarly and some sides began to realise was that they had been underestimating the value of aggression in one day cricket as well the second fundamental way in which t cricket changed cricket was in terms of skills the ipl and other leagues brought big money into the game this changed incentives for budding cricketers relatively few people break into test or odi cricket and play for their countries a much wider pool can aspire to play t cricket which also provides much more money so it makes sense to spend the hundreds of hours you are in the nets honing t skills rather than test match skills go to any nets practice and you will find many more kids practising innovative aggressive strokes than playing the forward defensive as a result batsmen today have a wider array of attacking strokes than earlier generations because every run counts more in t cricket the standard of fielding has also shot up and bowlers have also reacted to this by expanding their arsenal of tricks everyone has had to lift their game in one day cricket thus two things have happened one there is better strategic understanding about the value of aggression two batsmen are better equipped to act on the aggressive imperative the game has continued to evolve bowlers have reacted to this with greater aggression on their part and this ongoing dialogue has been fascinating the cricket writer gideon haigh once told me on my podcast that the world cup featured a battle between t batting and test match bowling this england team is the high watermark so far their aggression does not come from slogging they bat with a combination of intent and skills that allows them to coast at an over without needing to take too many risks in normal conditions thus they can coast to any hitting they do beyond that is the bonus that takes them to or it is a whole new level illustrated by the fact that at one point a few days ago they had seven consecutive scores of to their name look at their scores over the last few years in fact and it is clear that this is the greatest batting side in the history of one day cricket by a margin there have been stumbles in this world cup but in the bigger picture those are outliers if england have a bad day in the final and new zealand play their a game england might even lose today but if captain morgan s men play their a game they will coast to victory new zealand does not have those gears no other team in the world does for now but one day they will all have to learn to play like this by amit varma in this is the rd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india i had a strange dream last night i dreamt that the government had passed a law that made using laptops illegal i would have to write this column by hand i would also have to leave my home in mumbai to deliver it in person to my editor in delhi i woke up trembling and angry and realised how indian farmers feel every single day of their lives my column today is a tale of two satyagrahas both involve farmers technology and the freedom of choice one of them began this month but first let us go back to the turn of the millennium as the s came to an end cotton farmers across india were in distress pests known as bollworms were ravaging crops across the country farmers had to use increasing amounts of pesticide to keep them at bay the costs of the pesticide and the amount of labour involved made it unviable and often the crops would fail anyway then technology came to the rescue the farmers heard of bt cotton a genetically modified type of cotton that kept these pests away and was being used around the world but they were illegal in india even though no bad effects had ever been recorded well who cares about illegal when it is a matter of life and death farmers in gujarat got hold of bt cotton seeds from the black market and planted them you will never guess what happened next as began all cotton crops in gujarat failed except the hectares that had bt cotton the government did not care about the failed crops they cared about the illegal ones they ordered all the bt cotton crops to be destroyed it was time for a satyagraha and not just in gujarat the late sharad joshi leader of the shetkari sanghatana in maharashtra took around farmers to gujarat to stand with their fellows there they sat in the fields of bt cotton and basically said over our dead bodies joshi s point was simple all other citizens of india have access to the latest technology from all over they are all empowered with choice why should farmers be held back the satyagraha was successful the ban on bt cotton was lifted there are three things i would like to point out here one the lifting of the ban transformed cotton farming in india over of indian farmers now use bt cotton india has become the world s largest producer of cotton moving ahead of china according to agriculture expert ashok gulati india has gained us billion in the years since from higher exports and import savings because of bt cotton most importantly cotton farmers incomes have doubled two gmo crops have become standard across the world around million hectares of gmo crops have been planted worldwide and gmo foods are accepted in countries the humanitarian benefits have been massive golden rice a variety of rice packed with minerals and vitamins has prevented blindness in countless new born kids since it was introduced in the philippines three despite the fear mongering of some ngos whose existence depends on alarmism the science behind gmo is settled no harmful side effects have been noted in all these years and millions of lives impacted positively a couple of years ago over nobel laureates signed a petition asserting that gmo foods were safe and blasting anti science ngos that stood in the way of progress there is scientific consensus on this the science may be settled but the politics is not the government still bans some types of gmo seeds such as bt brinjal which was developed by an indian company called mahyco and used successfully in bangladesh more crucially a variety called ht bt cotton which fights weeds is also banned weeding takes up to of a farmer s time and often makes farming unviable farmers across the world use this variant of global cotton crops are ht bt indian farmers are so desperate for it that they choose to break the law and buy expensive seeds from the black market but the government is cracking down a farmer in haryana had his crop destroyed by the government in may on june this year a farmer named lalit bahale in the akola district of maharashtra kicked off a satyagraha by planting banned seeds of ht bt cotton and bt brinjal he was soon joined by thousands of farmers far from our urban eyes a heroic fight has begun our farmers already victimised and oppressed by a predatory government in countless ways are fighting for their right to take charge of their lives as this brave struggle unfolds i am left with a troubling question all those satyagrahas of the past by our great freedom fighters what were they for if all they got us was independence and not freedom by amit varma in this is the nd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india trade wars are on the rise and it is enough to get any nationalist all het up and excited earlier this week narendra modi s government that it would start imposing tariffs on us products starting today this is a response to similar treatment towards us from the us there is one thing i would invite you to consider trump and modi are not engaged in a war with each other instead they are waging war on their own people let us unpack that a bit part of the reason trump came to power is that he provided simple and wrong answers for people s problems he responded to the growing jobs crisis in middle america with two explanations one foreigners are coming and taking your jobs two your jobs are being shipped overseas both explanations are wrong but intuitive and they worked for trump he is stupid enough that he probably did not create these narratives for votes but actually believes them the first of those leads to the demonising of immigrants the second leads to a demonising of trade trump has acted on his rhetoric after becoming president and a modern us version of our old indira is india slogan might well be trump is tariff tariff is trump contrary to the fulminations of the economically illiterate all tariffs are bad without exception let me illustrate this with an example say there is a fictional product called brump a local brump costs rs foreign manufacturers appear and offer better brumps at a cheaper price say rs consumers shift to foreign brumps manufacturers of local brumps get angry and form an interest group they lobby the government or bribe it with campaign contributions to impose a tariff on import of brumps the government puts a rupee tariff the foreign brumps now cost rs and people start buying local brumps again this is a good thing right local businesses have been helped and local jobs have been saved but this is only the seen effect the unseen effect of this tariff is that millions of brump buyers would have saved rs per brump if there were no tariffs this money would have gone out into the economy been part of new demand generated more jobs everyone would have been better off and the overall standard of living would have been higher that brings to me to an essential truth about tariffs every tariff is a tax on your own people and every intervention in markets amounts to a distribution of wealth from the people at large to specific interest groups in other words from the poor to the rich the costs of this are dispersed and invisible what is rs to any of us and the benefits are large and worth fighting for local manufacturers of brumps can make crores extra much modern politics amounts to manufacturers of brumps buying politicians to redistribute money from us to them there are second order effects of protectionism as well when the us imposes tariffs on other countries those countries may respond by imposing tariffs back raw materials for many goods made locally are imported and as these become expensive so do those goods that quintessential american product the iphone uses parts from countries as local products rise in price because of expensive foreign parts prices rise demand goes down jobs are lost and everyone is worse off trump keeps talking about how he wants to win at trade but trade is not a zero sum game the most misunderstood term in our times is probably trade deficit a country has a trade deficit when it imports more than what it exports and trump thinks of that as a bad thing it is not i run a trade deficit with my domestic help and my local grocery store i buy more from them than they do from me that is fine because we all benefit it is a win win game similarly trade between countries is really trade between the people of both countries and people trade with each other because they are both better off to interfere in that process is to reduce the value created in their lives it is immoral to modify a slogan often identified with libertarians like me tariffs are theft these trade wars thus carry a touch of the absurd any leader who imposes tariffs is imposing a tax on his own people just see the chain of events trump taxes the american people in retaliation modi taxes the indian people trump raises taxes modi raises taxes nationalists in both countries cheer interests groups in both countries laugh their way to the bank what kind of idiocy is this how long will this lose lose game continue by amit varma in this is the st installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india when all political parties agree on something you know you might have a problem giriraj singh a minister in narendra modi s new cabinet that our population control law should become a movement this is something that would find bipartisan support we are taught from school onwards that india s population is a big problem and we need to control it this is wrong contrary to popular belief our population is not a problem it is our greatest strength the notion that we should worry about a growing population is an intuitive one the world has limited resources people keep increasing something s gotta give robert malthus made just this point in his book an essay on the principle of population he was worried that our population would grow exponentially while resources would grow arithmetically as more people entered the workforce wages would fall and goods would become scarce calamity was inevitable malthus s rationale was so influential that this mode of thinking was soon called malthusian it is a pejorative today a th century follower of his harrison brown came up with one of my favourite images on this subject arguing that a growing population would lead to the earth being covered completely and to a considerable depth with a writhing mass of human beings much as a dead cow is covered with a pulsating mass of maggots another malthusian paul ehrlich published a book called the population bomb in which began with the stirring lines the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now ehrlich was as you would guess a big supporter of india s coercive family planning programs i do not see he wrote how india could possibly feed two hundred million more people by none of these fears have come true a study by nicholas eberstadt called found no correlation between population density and poverty the greater the density of people the more you would expect them to fight for resources and yet monaco which has times the population density of bangladesh is doing well for itself so is bahrain which has three times the population density of india not only does population not cause poverty it makes us more prosperous the economist julian simon pointed out in a book that through history whenever there has been a spurt in population it has coincided with a spurt in productivity such as for example between malthus s time and now there were around a billion people on earth in and there are around billion today as you read these words consider that you are better off than the richest person on the planet then why is this the answer lies in the title of simon s book the ultimate resource when we speak of resources we forget that human beings are the finest resource of all there is no limit to our ingenuity and we interact with each other in positive sum ways every voluntary interactions leaves both people better off and the amount of value in the world goes up this is why we want to be part of economic networks that are as large and as dense as possible this is why most people migrate to cities rather than away from them and why cities are so much richer than towns or villages if malthusians were right essential commodities like wheat maize and rice would become relatively scarcer over time and thus more expensive but they have actually become much cheaper in real terms this is thanks to the productivity and creativity of humans who in eberstadt s words are in practice always renewable and in theory entirely inexhaustible the error made by malthus brown and ehrlich is the same error that our politicians make today and not just in the context of population zero sum thinking if our population grows and resources stays the same of course there will be scarcity but this is never the case all we need to do to learn this lesson is look at our cities this mistaken thinking has had savage humanitarian consequences in india think of the unborn millions over the decades because of our brutal family planning policies how many tendulkars rahmans and satyajit rays have we lost think of the immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country and finally think of the condescension of our politicians asserting that people are india s problem but always other people never themselves this arrogance is india s greatest problem not our people by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india amit shah s induction into the union cabinet is such an interesting moment even partisans who oppose the bjp as i do would admit that shah is a political genius under his leadership the bjp has become an electoral behemoth in the most complicated political landscape in the world the big question that now arises is this can shah do for india what he did for the bjp this raises a perplexing question in the last five years as the bjp has flourished india has languished and yet the leadership of both the party and the nation are more or less the same then why has not the ability to manage the party translated to governing the country i would argue that there are two reasons for this one the skills required in those two tasks are different two so are the incentives in play let us look at the skills first managing a party like the bjp is in some ways like managing a large multinational company shah is a master at top down planning and micro management the elections described in detail in prashant jha s book how the bjp wins should be a harvard business school case study the book describes how he fixed the bjp s ground game in uttar pradesh picking teams for booths in uttar pradesh monitoring them and keeping them accountable shah looked at the market segmentation in up and hit upon his now famous formula he realised he could not deliver the votes of muslims yadavs and jatavs who were of the population so he focussed on wooing the other including non yadav obcs and non jatav dalits he carried out versions of these caste reconfigurations across states and according to jha covered over lakh kilometres between and consolidating market share in every state in this country he nurtured a pool of a thousand new obc and dalit leaders going well beyond the posturing of other parties that so many dalits and obcs voted for the bjp in is astonishing shah went past mandal politics managing to subsume previously antagonistic castes and sub castes into a broad hindutva identity and as the bjp increased its depth it expanded its breadth as well what it has done in west bengal wiping out the left and weakening mamata banerjee is jaw dropping with hindsight it may one day seem inevitable but only a madman could have conceived it and only a genius could have executed it good man to be home minister then eh not quite a country is not like a large company or even a political party it is much too complex to be managed from the top down and a control freak is bound to flounder the approach needed is very different some tasks of governance it is true are tailor made for efficient managers building infrastructure taking care of roads and power building toilets even without an underlying drainage system and pr campaigns can all be executed by good managers but the deeper tasks of making an economy flourish require a different approach they need a light touch not a heavy hand the th century is full of cautionary tales that show that economies cannot be centrally planned from the top down examples of that fatal conceit to use my hero friedrich hayek s term include the soviet union mao s china and even the lady modi most reminds me of indira gandhi the task of the state when it comes to the economy is to administer a strong rule of law and to make sure it is applied equally no special favours to cronies or special interest groups just unleash the natural creativity of the people and do not try to micro manage sadly the bjp s impulse like that of most governments of the past is a statist one india should have a small state that does a few things well instead we have a large state that does many things badly and acts as a parasite on its people as it happens the few things that we should do well are all right up shah s managerial alley for example the rule of law is effectively absent in india today especially for the poor as home minister shah could fix this if he applied the same zeal to governing india as he did to growing the bjp but will he and here we come to the question of incentives what drives amit shah maximising power or serving the nation what is good for the country will often coincide with what is good for the party but not always when they diverge which path will shah choose so much rests on that by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a friend of mine was very impressed by the interview narendra modi granted last week to akshay kumar such a charming man such great work ethic he gushed he is the kind of uncle i would want my kids to have and then in the same breath he asked how can such a good man be such a bad prime minister i do not want to be uncharitable and suggest that modi s image is entirely manufactured so let us take the interview at face value let us also grant modi his claims about the purity of his neeyat intentions and reframe the question this way when it comes to public policy why do good intentions often lead to bad outcomes to attempt an answer i will refer to a story a friend of mine who knows modi well once told me about him modi was chilling with his friends at home more than a decade ago and told them an incident from his childhood his mother was ill once and the young narendra was tending to her the heat was enervating so the boy went to the switchboard to switch on the fan but there was no electricity my friend said that as he told this story modi s eyes filled with tears even after all these years he was moved by the memory my friend used this story to make the point that modi s vision of the world is experiential if he experiences something he understands it when he became chief minister of gujarat he made it his stated mission to get reliable electricity to every part of gujarat no doubt this was shaped by the time he flicked a switch as a young boy and the fan did not budge similarly he has given importance to things like roads and cleanliness since he would have experienced the impact of those as a young man my term for him inspired by rajat kapoor s film is the ankhon dekhi prime minister at one level this is a good thing he sees a problem and works for the rest of his life to solve it but what of things he cannot experience the economy is a complex beast as is society itself and beyond a certain level you need to grasp abstract concepts to understand how the world works you cannot experience them for example spontaneous order or the idea that society and markets like language cannot be centrally directed or planned or the positive sum nature of things which is the engine of our prosperity the idea that every transaction is a win win game and that for one person to win another does not have to lose or indeed respect for individual rights and free speech one understands abstract concepts by reading about them understanding them applying them to the real world modi is not known to be a reader and this is not his fault given his background it is a near miracle that he has made it this far he was not born into a home with a reading culture and did not have either the resources or the time when he was young to devote to reading the only way he could learn about the world thus was by experiencing it there are two lessons here one for modi himself and others in his position and another for everyone the lesson in this for modi is a lesson for anyone who rises to such an important position even if he is the smartest person in the world that lesson is to have humility about the bounds of your knowledge and to surround yourself with experts who can advise you well be driven by values and not confidence in your own knowledge gather intellectual giants around you and stand on their shoulders modi did not do this in the case of demonetisation which he carried out against the advice of every expert he consulted we all know the damage it caused to the economy the other learning from this is for all of us how do we make sense of the world by connecting dots an ankhon dekhi approach will get us very few dots and our view of the world will be blurred and incomplete the best way to gather more dots is reading the more we read the better we understand the world and the better the decisions we take when we can experience a thousand lives through books why restrict ourselves to one a good man with noble intentions can make bad decisions with horrible consequences the only way to hedge against this is by staying humble and reading more so when you finish reading this piece think of an unread book that you would like to read today and read it by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the man who gave us our national anthem rabindranath tagore once wrote that nationalism was a great menace he went on to say it is the particular thing which for years has been at the bottom of india s troubles not just india s but the world s in his book the open society and its enemies published in as adolf hitler was defeated karl popper ripped into nationalism with all its appeals to our tribal instincts to passion and to prejudice and to our nostalgic desire to be relieved from the strain of individual responsibility which it attempts to replace by a collective or group responsibility nationalism is resurgent today stomping across the globe hand in hand with populism in india too it is tearing us apart but must nationalism always be a bad thing a provocative new book by the israeli thinker yael tamir argues otherwise in her book why nationalism tamir makes the following arguments one nation states are here to stay two the state needs the nation to be viable three people need nationalism for the sense of community and belonging it gives them four therefore we need to build a better nationalism which brings people together instead of driving them apart the first point needs no elaboration we are a globalised world but we are also trapped by geography and circumstance only percent of the world s population tamir points out lives outside their country of birth nutopia the borderless state dreamed up by john lennon and yoko ono is not happening anytime soon if the only thing that citizens of a state have in common is geographical circumstance it is not enough if the state is a necessary construct a nation is its necessary justification political institutions crave to form long term political bonding writes tamir and for that matter they must create a community that is neither momentary nor meaningless nationalism she says endows the state with intimate feelings linking the past the present and the future more pertinently tamir argues people need nationalism i am a humanist with a belief in individual rights but tamir says that this is not enough the term human is a far too thin mode of delineation she writes individuals need to rely on thick identities to make their lives meaningful this involves a shared past a common culture and distinctive values tamir also points out that there is a strong correlation between social class and political preferences the privileged elites can afford to be globalists but those less well off are inevitably drawn to other narratives that enrich their lives rather than seeing nationalism as the last refuge of the scoundrel writes tamir we should start thinking of nationalism as the last hope of the needy tamir s book bases its arguments on the west but the argument holds in india as well in a country with so much poverty is it any wonder that nationalism is on the rise the cosmopolitan globe trotting elites do not have daily realities to escape but how are those less fortunate to find meaning in their lives i have one question though why is our nationalism so exclusionary when our nation is so inclusive in the nationalism that our ruling party promotes there are some communities who belong here and others who do not and even among those who belong they exploit divisions in their us vs them vision of the world some religions are foreign some values are foreign even some culinary traditions are foreign and therefore frowned upon but the india i know and love is just the opposite of that we embrace influences from all over our language our food our clothes our music our cinema have absorbed so many diverse influences that to pretend they come from a single legit source is absurd even the elegant churidar kurtas our prime minister wears have an islamic origin as an example take the recent film gully boy its style of music the clothes its protagonists wear even the attitudes in the film would have seemed alien to us a few decades ago and yet could there be a truer portrait of young india this inclusiveness this joyous khichdi that we are is what makes our nation a model for the rest of the world no nation embraces all other nations as ours does my india celebrates differences and i do as well i wear my kurta with jeans i listen to ghazals i eat dhansak and kababs and i dream in the indian language called english this is my nationalism those who try to divide us therefore are the true anti nationals we must reclaim nationalism from them by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india one of my favourite english words comes from chess if it is your turn to move but any move you make makes your position worse you are in zugzwang narendra modi was in zugzwang after the pulwama attacks a few days agoas any indian prime minister in his place would have been an indian pm after an attack for which pakistan is held responsible has only unsavoury choices in front of him he is pulled in two opposite directions one strategy dictates that he must not escalate two politics dictates that he must let us unpack that first consider the strategic imperatives ever since both india and pakistan became nuclear powers a conventional war has become next to impossible because of the threat of a nuclear war if india escalates beyond a point pakistan might bring their nuclear weapons into play even a limited nuclear war could cause millions of casualties and devastate our economy thus no matter what the provocation india needs to calibrate its response so that the pakistan does not take it all the way it is impossible to predict what actions pakistan might view as sufficient provocation so india has tended to play it safe do not capture territory do not attack military assets do not kill civilians in other words surgical strikes on alleged terrorist camps is the most we can do given that pakistan knows that it is irrational for india to react and our leaders tend to be rational they can bleed us with a thousand cuts as their doctrine states with impunity both in when our parliament was attacked and the bjp s atal bihari vajpayee was pm and in when mumbai was attacked and the congress s manmohan singh was pm our leaders considered all the options on the tablebut were forced to do nothing but is doing nothing an option in an election year leave strategy aside and turn to politics india has been attacked forty soldiers have been killed and the nation is traumatised and baying for blood it is now politically impossible to not retaliateespecially for a pm who has criticized his predecessor for being weak and portrayed himself as a inch chested man of action i have no doubt that modi is a rational man and knows the possible consequences of escalation but he also knows the possible consequences of not escalatinghe could dilute his brand and lose the elections thus he is forced to act and after he acts his pakistan counterpart will face the same domestic pressure to retaliate and will have to attack back and so on till my home in versova is swallowed up by a nuclear crater right well not exactly there is a way to resolve this paradox india and pakistan can both escalate not via military actions but via optics modi and imran khan who you would expect to feel like the loneliest men on earth right now can find sweet company in each other their incentives are aligned neither man wants this to turn into a full fledged war both men want to appear macho in front of their domestic constituencies both men are masters at building narratives and have a pliant media that will help them thus india can carry out a surgical strike and claim it destroyed a camp killed terrorists and forced pakistan to return a braveheart prisoner of war pakistan can say india merely destroyed two trees plus a rock and claim the high moral ground by returning the prisoner after giving him good masala tea a benign military equilibrium is maintained and both men come out looking like strong leaders a win win game for the pms that avoids a lose lose game for their nations they can give themselves a high five in private when they meet next and imran can whisper to modi you are a good spinner bro there is one problem here though what if the optics do not work if modi feels that his public is too sceptical and he needs to do more he might feel forced to resort to actual military escalation the fog of politics might obscure the possible consequences if the resultant indian military action causes serious damage pakistan will have to respond in kind in the chain of events that then begins with body bags piling up neither man may be able to back down they could end up as prisoners of circumstanceand so could we also check out amit varma the two pakistansepisode of the seen and the unseen india in the nuclear ageepisode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india steven pinker in his book enlightenment now relates an old russian joke about two peasants named boris and igor they are both poor boris has a goat igor does not one day igor is granted a wish by a visiting fairy what will he wish for i wish he says that boris s goat should die the joke ends there revealing as much about human nature as about economics consider the three things that happen if the fairy grants the wish one boris becomes poorer two igor stays poor three inequality reduces is any of them a good outcome i feel exasperated when i hear intellectuals and columnists talking about economic inequality it is my contention that india s problem is poverty and that poverty and inequality are two very different things that often do not coincide to illustrate this i sometimes ask this question in which of the following countries would you rather be poor usa or bangladesh the obvious answer is usa where the poor are much better off than the poor of bangladesh and yet while bangladesh has greater poverty the usa has higher inequality indeed take a look at the countries of the world measured by the gini index which is that standard metric used to measure inequality and you will find that usa hong kong singapore and the united kingdom all have greater inequality than bangladesh liberia pakistan and sierra leone which are much poorer and yet while the poor of bangladesh would love to migrate to unequal usa i do not hear of too many people wishing to go in the opposite direction indeed people vote with their feet when it comes to choosing between poverty and inequality all of human history is a story of migration from rural areas to cities which have greater inequality if poverty and inequality are so different why do people conflate the two a key reason is that we tend to think of the world in zero sum ways for someone to win someone else must lose if the rich get richer the poor must be getting poorer and the presence of poverty must be proof of inequality but that is not how the world works the pie is not fixed economic growth is a positive sum game and leads to an expansion of the pie and everybody benefits in absolute terms the rich get richer and so do the poor often enough to come out of poverty and so in any growing economy as poverty reduces inequality tends to increase this is counter intuitive i know so used are we to zero sum thinking this is exactly what has happened in india since we liberalised parts of our economy in most people who complain about inequality in india are using the wrong word and are really worried about poverty put a millionaire in a room with a billionaire and no one will complain about the inequality in that room but put a starving beggar in there and the situation is morally objectionable it is the poverty that makes it a problem not the inequality you might think that this is just semantics but words matter poverty and inequality are different phenomena with opposite solutions you can solve for inequality by making everyone equally poor or you could solve for it by redistributing from the rich to the poor as if the pie was fixed the problem with this as any economist will tell you is that there is a trade off between redistribution and growth all redistribution comes at the cost of growing the pie and only growth can solve the problem of poverty in a country like ours it has been estimated that in india for every one percent rise in gdp two million people come out of poverty that is a stunning statistic when millions of indians do not have enough money to eat properly or sleep with a roof over their heads it is our moral imperative to help them rise out of poverty the policies that will make this possible allowing free markets incentivising investment and job creation removing state oppression are likely to lead to greater inequality so what it is more urgent to make sure that every indian has enough to fulfil his basic needs what the philosopher harry frankfurt in his fine book on inequality called the doctrine of sufficiency the elite in their airconditioned drawing rooms and those who live in rich countries can follow the fashions of the west and talk compassionately about inequality india does not have that luxury by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india it is election season and promises are raining down on voters like rose petals on naive newlyweds earlier this week the congress party announced a minimum income guarantee for the poor this friday the modi government released a budget full of sops as the days go by the promises will get bolder and you might feel important that so much attention is being given to you well the joke is on you every election hl mencken once said is an advance auction sale of stolen goods a bunch of competing mafias fight to rule over you for the next five years you decide who wins on the basis of who can bribe you better with your own money this is an absurd situation which i tried to express in a couple of years ago politics a neta who loves currency notes told me what his line of work denotes it is kind of funny we steal people s money and use some of it to buy their votes we are the dupes here and we pay far more to keep this circus going than this circus costs it would be okay if the parties once they came to power provided good governance but voters have given up on that and now only want patronage and handouts that leads to one of the biggest problems in indian politics we are stuck in an equilibrium where all good politics is bad economics and vice versa for example the minimum guarantee for the poor is good politics because the optics are great it is basically garibi hatao that slogan made indira gandhi a political juggernaut in the s at the same time that she unleashed a series of economic policies that kept millions of people in garibi for decades longer than they should have been this time the congress has released no details and keeping it vague makes sense because i find it hard to see how it can make economic sense depending on how they define poor how much income they offer and what the cost is the plan will either be ineffective or unworkable the modi government s interim budget announced a handout for poor farmers that seemed rather pointless given our agricultural distress offering a poor farmer bucks a month seems almost like mockery such condescending handouts solve nothing the poor want jobs and opportunities those come with growth which requires structural reforms structural reforms do not sound sexy as election promises handouts do a classic example is farm loan waivers we have reached a stage in our politics where every party has to promise them to assuage farmers who are a strong vote bank everywhere you cannot blame farmers for wanting them they are a necessary anaesthetic but no government has yet made a serious attempt at tackling of our agricultural crisis why is it that good politics in india is always bad economics let me put forth some possible reasons one voters tend to think in zero sum ways as if the pie is fixed and the only way to bring people out of poverty is to redistribute the truth is that trade is a positive sum game and nations can only be lifted out of poverty when the whole pie grows but this is unintuitive two indian politics revolves around identity and patronage the spoils of power are limited that is indeed a zero sum game so you are likely to vote for whoever can look after the interests of your in group rather than care about the economy as a whole three voters tend to stay uninformed for good reasons because of what public choice economists call rational ignorance a single vote is unlikely to make a difference in an election so why put in the effort to understand the nuances of economics and governance just ask what is in it for me and go with whatever seems to be the best answer four politicians have a short term horizon geared towards winning the next election a good policy that may take years to play out is unattractive a policy that will win them votes in the short term is preferable sadly no indian party has shown a willingness to aim for the long term the congress has produced new gandhis but not new ideas and while the bjp did make some solid promises in they did not walk that talk and have proved to be as arun shourie once called them upa cow even the congress is adopting the cow in fact so maybe the bjp will add temple to that mix benjamin franklin once said democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch this election season my friends the people of india are on the menu you have been deveined and deboned marinated with rhetoric seasoned with narrative now enter the oven and vote by amit varma in a slightly shorter version of this was published as the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india whenever the pressures of the world get too much for me i lighten the burden by going over to donald trump s twitter feed trump the only president who would fail the turing test keeps lashing out at opponents and saying outrageous things often in all caps the internet version of screaming it is wonderfully entertaining and got even more so when he lashed out at narendra modi last week trump said i could give you an example where i get along very well with india and prime minister modi but he is constantly telling me he built a library in afghanistan library that is like five hours of what we spend and he tells me he is very smart we are supposed to say oh thank you for the library do not know who is using it in afghanistan modi fanbois also tend to be trump fanbois because they like macho men and this must have been confusing to them at multiple levels one why was trump lashing out at modi two if trump is telling the truth why does modi keep boasting about building a library three what library after much googling in the pmo our officials figured that despite having spent over us billion in afghanistan since we had not built a library maybe trump confused the parliament building with a library but it was unlikely that modi would boast to trump even about that especially constantly so trump was lying right no trump was not lying i say he was bullshitting i am not just dropping slang here bullshit may appear to be a pejorative but it has become a technical term after the philosopher harry frankfurt published his seminal book on bullshit in and if we are to understand the likes of trump it is important to understand the distinction between bullshit and lies a liar as per frankfurt acknowledges the truth and aims to deceive for a bullshitter the truth is irrelevant bullshitters aim not to deceive but are just winging it saying whatever comes into their head at a given point in time which may or may not be true for trump everything comes down to how macho he is and how others are messing around at america s expense and only he can stop them his boast about modi constantly talking to him about a library was in this vein he could also have said that modi wears ladies underwear or modi begged him to open a casino in lutyen s delhi or modi wore a suit with his name on it any relationship that bullshit has with the truth is usually coincidental trump bullshits a lot and then doubles down on his bullshit once he has released it for example the wall that mexico will pay for i am sure he was winging it when he first came up with it ironically his latest target is a master bullshitter himself when modi spoke of the first plastic surgery in india being done on lord ganesha or climate change being a consequence of people getting older he was not lying but bullshitting he is not educated or knowledgeable enough to know the truth in any of those cases so it does not matter to him and it seems not to matter to any of us either politicians can get away with bullshit and lying because people do not care about facts we tend to form echo chambers with like minded people form whatever worldview appeals to us and shut ourselves off from conflicting views behavioural scientists point to hard wiring in the brain that strengthens this process the confirmation bias ensures that we only consider facts that agree with our worldview and ignore the rest the backfire effect worryingly for fact checkers ensures that our worldviews actually grow stronger when we are presented with conflicting evidence these echo chambers once formed tend to grow more and more strident experiments by social scientists have found that when people with similar opinions are thrown together in a group they tend to take decisions more extreme than any one individual would take this is known as group polarisation you see this in social media where discourse is polarised and opposing sides are talking past each other not to each other with every individual performing to impress his own side when all discourse takes place along tribal lines rhetoric matters facts do not is bullshit a feature or a bug an entire nation will vote upon it this year as india goes to the polls narendra modi has focussed entirely on optics and not on performance betting that once people have formed a narrative inside their heads facts are irrelevant is an a in campaigning more important than a f in governance we will soon find out what the people of india think by amit varma in this is the th installment of rhyme and reason my occasional set of limericks for the sunday times of india edit page wave goodbye a hindutva boss at a conclave said amit things are so very grave we are in dire straits we lost ground in five states someone save us from this modi wave hypocrisy the congress neta looked all around and then told me amit i have found my high command s a gem made kamal nath cm and gave away the high moral ground by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the late farmer leader sharad joshi used to enjoy reciting a poem that described the indian farmer s plight perfectly it addresses the non farmer from the farmer s point of view and it goes marte hum bhi hain marte tum bhi ho marte hum bhi hain marte tum bhi ho hum sasta bech ke marte hain tum mahanga khareedke marte ho i would translate it thus i die my friend and so do you i die my friend and so do you i sell my produce cheap and die you pay so much that you die too this beautiful shair expresses an old truth that many investigative journalists wrote about anew this week as protesting farmers congregated on delhi the gap between what farmers get for their produce and what the consumer pays one report revealed that a farmer sold tomatoes at rs per kg and consumers bought them for rs too little and too much both the farmers and consumers were getting killed by this just like in the poem joshi s insight in the late s was that this was caused not by the greed of middlemen but the interference of the indian state the state had set forth rules that the farmer could not sell his produce in an open market responding to supply and demand but only to a government appointed body called the agricultural produce market committee apmc because the farmers are not allowed to sell to anyone else they are forced to take the price offered to them and because all produce comes through the apmc buyers also have no bargaining power now imagine what would happen if the free market was allowed to operate middlemen would compete to buy goods from farmers and that competition would ensure that farmers would get a better price they would also compete for customers this ensuring that customers would pay less instead of farmers selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs you could have the farmer selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs both farmer and consumer would benefit by rs per kg but the government does not allow this and both farmers and consumers get hurt joshi referred to this notional cost paid by the farmer as a negative subsidy he viewed it correctly as theft the issue here is not that farmers are hard up and the government is not helping them the issue is that the government is responsible for the poverty of the farmer and is stealing from him and this is not the only way that the government is crippling our farmers farmers are not allowed access to markets in anything they do the state does not allow free markets in inputs because of which many of the inputs a farmer needs from seeds to fertilisers to energy to even credit are either hard to come by or of a low quality and when they do manage to produce crops they are not allowed to get the best price for it as an open market would enable by denying them freedom the state effectively imprisons our farmers in what a friend of mine calls ppp perpetually planned poverty this extends not just to their produce but to their property farmers are not allowed to sell their land for non agricultural purposes this restricts their market to other farmers and ensures that the price they can get for their land is so low that it becomes pointless to sell it has been estimated that some farmland would be forty times as valuable if this law did not exist indeed a common scam is for a crony of the state to acquire land from farmers through the state at low prices and then get the land use certificate changed so that they can sell at many multiples of that price all perfectly legal and deeply unethical this is how robert vadra was alleged to have made his money in fact every political party in our history has let our farmers down but there is a reason things are coming to a head now india is already facing a jobs crisis made worse by the deepening of the agricultural crisis with every generation land holdings get smaller one farmer s land is split among multiple children and more and more unsustainable it is no coincidence that many recent popular uprisings have been around demand for jobs from land owning castes like like jats patidars and marathas indian agriculture has been in crisis for decades more than of our country is in the agricultural sector producing of our gdp in developing countries less than of the population works in agriculture here we have trapped our farmers in poverty and also not allowed the industrial revolution that would have provided an escape route we pay lip service to farmers but instead of making the necessary structural reforms we give handouts like farm loan waivers that provide only temporary relief it is like handing aspirin to a burning man here we say take this for the pain and everybody claps also check out epsiode of the seen and the unseen featuring farmer leader gunvant

a year of glorious gifts from unelected middle aged men the supreme court of india is churning out enlightened judgements as if oppression is going out of fashion privacy and now adultery on thursday the court struck down section of the indian penal code this section read whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man without the consent or connivance of that man such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape is guilty of the offense of adultery and shall be punished as the part about the consent of the husband indicates the law treated women as the property of their husbands and adultery like a form of theft justice dy chandrachud wrote in his judgement the history of section reveals that the law on adultery was for the benefit of the husband for him to secure ownership over the sexuality of his wife it was aimed at preventing the woman from exercising her sexual agency as chandrachud elaborates in his judgement this has been a ubiquitous attitude towards adultery throughout history babylon s ancient hammurabi code prescribed that a married woman caught in adultery be bound to her lover and thrown into the water so that they drown together no such punishment for an unfaithful man mind you ancient greco roman societies considered adultery to be a violation of a husband s exclusive sexual access to his wife and judaic and christian laws followed a similar logic this went beyond ancient times in england introduced the death penalty for adultery with the act for suppressing the detestable sins of incest adultery and fornication section which they later thrust upon this particular colony was an adulterated version of this in the st century no law should deny the autonomy and agency of a woman but what if society itself is regressive and denies women basic human dignity as is the case in india chandrachud remarks law and society are intrinsically connected and oppressive social values often find expression in legal structures but he adds the constitution both in text and interpretation has played a significant role in the evolution of law from being an instrument of oppression to becoming one of liberation one bad law has gone but we remain a nation in which women are second class citizens firstly similar laws remain in the books such as section which deals with enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman and also treats women as the property of men secondly hell look at indian society around you some of us engish speaking elite types imagine that things must be getting better because we see so many strong articulate women around us but that is the selection bias at play outside these circles women in india are having a tough time women still fill government forms that insist on father s husbands name as if to establish ownership one telling metric female participation in the workforce has actually gone down in the last two decades much of what we call empowerment is on the terms of men so many men signal how modern they are by boasting about how they let their wife work or how they help out with domestic chores they behave as if they deserve a pat of their backs for not beating their wives and chaining them to the kitchen we have set the bar so low that not being a monster is now a matter of congratulations men tend to be oblivious of how women carry their gender as a burden something i realised recently and shame on me for being so late to realise it in my forties is that my gender is not a factor in my everyday life i can ignore and take for granted my maleness but in every single thing a woman does her gender comes into play an empty compartment at a train station the tone of voice in a job interview the supercilious sniggering men who always interrupt whose eyes travel like you know their hands would if they had the license every day women have to confront and make peace with their own thingness every day they find new reasons to question themselves the ever present human anxiety about what others think of us is amplified for women and restraint becomes a reflex i have a secondary rant here just as the adultery law saw women as the property of men many of our laws and parts of our constitution treat citizens as the property of the state we are subjects of a mai baap master which can regulate our speech and our behaviour we take this for granted just as many women take the oppression they face for granted we cannot be a free society until we address this the supreme court cannot deliver us from ourselves no matter how ugly the sight we must look within also check out amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen amit varma amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the third installment of my cricket column for cricket next and was published on september every time india loses a test series abroad the doomed relationship between the indian cricket fan and the indian cricket player comes into focus the player usually disappoints the fan and when the fan is delighted it is often for the wrong reason this is because the player and the fan look at the game in completely different ways so different in fact that we might be talking about different sports here the crux of this difference the indian cricket fan is results oriented there have been many loud judgements made by fans in the course of this series against england all expressed with great passion and conviction hardik pandya should not have played the first two tests virat kohli was right to pick hardik for the third test redemption kohli was wrong to pick hardik for the fourth and he must be dropped i have heard these three come from the same person though they are absurd together kl rahul should be not be in the side after the fifth test wait oops what these judgements and so many others through the series have in common is that they are based on results consider the different types of judgements fans tend to pass judgements around selection so and so should not be picked instead of you and yo example picking rohit sharma instead of ajinkya rahane at the start of the test series in south africa judgements around events what a horrible shot rishabh pant played to get out in the fifth test bad boy judgements around a side s approach why were rahul and pant so aggressive after tea on the fifth day in the fifth test maybe we could have gotten a draw if they had tried to play the day out judgements around well results we lost we are a horrible side i am not taking a position on these specific judgements but on the basis on which they are made at this point you would be justified in asking me wtf columnist bro if we do not make judgements based on results what do we base them on do not players look at the game the same way should not they well no all elite sportspeople think about the game probabilistically and are not results oriented they value process more than results that is the only route to success in anything and i learnt it viscerally when i shifted from being a fan to a player not a cricket player do not worry after about a decade in cricket journalism i chucked it around eight years ago and spent five years as a professional poker player poker is a game of skill but has a higher quantum of luck than other sports in fact it has been said that the key skill in poker is the management of luck this might well be true to any other sport and of life itself one of the early lessons i learnt in poker was that one cannot be results oriented i will not bore you with poker talk so let me give my favourite illustration of this i promise this is relevant to cricket and kohli and so bear with me let us say you have an evenly weighted coin that will fall heads or tails of the time each over the long run a friend offers you a deal you will flip that coin an unspecified number of times every time it hands on heads he will give you rs every time it lands on tails you give him rs it does not take rocket science to figure out why this is profitable you calculate the expected value ev of a single flip to be rs if you flip it times you get x and lose x to gain rupees divide by the more you flip the more money you make it is clearly right to accept the bet and start spinning that coin but here s the thing thinking probabilistically tells you that the decision to flip the coin is always profitable to the tune of one rupee but the actual result is always a harsh binary you either win bucks or lose let us say you flip the coin once it lands on tails and your friend takes the money and walks off does that make it a bad decision maybe he sees your downcast face and spins it again tails again now hell he could even get ten tails in a row unlikely as that seems ten tails in a row is actually inevitable at some point if you spin the coin enough and you just got unlucky here to get a sense of this do read my old piece so you end up as a big loser but does this mean your decision making was flawed the key to winning in poker is to keep making the best decision you can and not worry about the short term variance of results this is also the key to winning in life but i will not bore you any more on this for a deeper explanation involving football and parallel universes do read my old essay my point is that all actions in all sports carry probabilities with them and have an inherent ev for example when lionel messi find the ball at his feet three feet outside the box with two defenders converging to get in his way he knows the probabilities of a trying to weave his way through them to score directly b drawing them away from the goal and passing into the space his run would have created for his colleague luis suarez c suarez scoring from there d messi just going for a direct shot on goal now e messi sprinting into the box and falling hoping for a penalty these numbers would be internalised by messi s coaches and the optimal behaviour in such a spot would be second nature to messi the thing is he could make the optimal move with a chance of success and miss he could do something sub optimal with a chance and succeed as he will one twentieth of the time in that situation the first decision would not be wrong just because he did not score the second would not be right just because he did we have no way of knowing though messi is in the best position to judge and we can only tell how good a player s decision making is over an extremely long term when we have good enough sample sizes to draw reliable conclusions in cricket that long term is not possible now consider the many kinds of ev a captain like virat kohli has to calculate when he takes the field one is of the strategic value of aggression should batsmen be aggressive and show intent in test matches the merit in this you do not let bowlers get into a rhythm you could take the game away in one good session if it works the confidence can create a decisive virtuous cycle the danger you could lose too many wickets too quickly when it does not work and lose the game in a session the players who fail thus could lose confidence this could create a vicious cycle this is a tough decision every test match has uniquely different conditions and it is impossible to get a large enough sample size to come to any conclusion i would need data from tens of thousands of games with and without this approach to have confidence in a judgement in the absence of such a sample a captain like kohli has to go with his gut to form a philosophy around this he has chosen aggression and prefers free scoring batsmen like kl rahul shikhar dhawan and hardik pandya to plodders like cheteshwar pujara and ajinkya rahane he is no doubt biased by the good results of his own aggression ignoring the fact that the risk reward ratio is different for him because he is a superior player to all the guys named above from the ev of a strategy let us move to the ev of a specific decision picking hardik pandya in a test xi in england i am a fan of pandya and i think kohli s rationale for playing him would be the same as mine he is an under rated batsman whose aggression can swing a game in a session even if he averages five runs an innings lower than a specialist no batsman the ten useful overs he can provide in a day giving rest to the specialist bowlers is worth those five runs playing him instead of a specialist no in my opinion carries a positive ev now he was our matchwinner in the third test and kohli s faith in him seemed vindicated he flopped in the fourth and had to be dropped following the public outcry from fans but this is indisputable his ev in the third and fourth test was identical the results though were very different what is that ev should he play tests for us we can make our own judgements on that but those two results which drew such acclaim and derision respectively are for all practical purposes random noise at the moment the results indicate that kohli is a bad captain and made mistakes in this series but are five tests in england enough to judge in a season where this batch of the duke s ball swung more than normal tosses were decisive and england won all the tosses could the probabilities have been on his side but not luck are fans being harsh by judging kohli on the results of the series what are the possible counterfactuals i do not want to defend kohli or take a specific stance here nor am i arguing that we should suspend all judgement entirely but we should be aware that what happens on a cricket field is an inadequate way to evaluate a game because it is a tiny fraction of what the sport is about the real drama of cricket the ebb and flow that matters lies in the possibilities and probabilities of what can happen not in the boring binaries of what does watching the game would be a richer experience for us if we focussed as the players do on the journey and not the destination by amit varma in this is the second installment of my cricket column for cricket next and was published on september george bernard shaw once wrote a play called man and superman you could steal that title and use it for a film on virat kohli s life right now as a batsman he is in superhero territory he plays every match on a different easier pitch than his colleagues do and has established himself as an all time great english conditions were once held to be his kryptonyte but he is put that to rest with his sublime batting in this series leaving aside costume requirementshe still wears his underwear inside his pantshe is every bit a batting superhero kohli is also the captain of his side though and in that avatar is just a frail human india was walloped in south africa earlier this year and just lost the fourth test in england to go down both these opponents were themselves far from at their best and the decisions kohli made as captain have gotten much of the flak for these defeats especially selectorial decisions why rohit over rahane at the start of the sa series why drop cheteshwar pujara in the first test in england why persist with hardik pandya when he does not seem to bring enough value with either bat or ball i agree with some of those criticisms but not others and i feel the critics may be making a mistake by being too results orientedi will elaborate on that in my next column it is certainly true though that while kohli has transcended his human limitations when it comes to the skill of batting he has not done so when it comes to decision making as a captain like all of us he has a flawed machine inside his skull with modules that evolved as features in prehistoric times but which are bugs now there are cognitive biases and flawed heuristic that can lead us astray in our decision making and i will try to address some of them in this piece note that while i will cite examples of specific decisions i am not taking a position on any of them here maybe they were good decisions unfairly criticized maybe they were bad ones maybe we will never know i am just going to lay out some of the traps that anyone who selects a cricket team can fall intoand these apply to all of us in everything we do do they apply to kohli that is something for youand himto think about first up there is the which is defined as a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person s mind when evaluating a specific topic concept method or decision there are various ways this can play out number one when a captain speaks up in selection meetings he is likely to favour players he has actually seen up close as opposed to those who have performed as well but he has not seen so much of them this could lead kohli for example to be more likely to bat for players who qualities he knows personally from teams he has played for like rcb or it could lead to the where he opts to stick with players he is familiar with rather than take a risk on the relatively unknown this can also come from the a cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information kohli is not the sole selector of course and you could argue that they often pick fresh talent from the ipl more than from domestic cricket because the ipl is much more in the spotlight domestic first class cricket is supposed to be the feeder system for test cricket and by that logic you would imagine mayank agarwal with his prolific performances in the ranji trophy would be in the indian squad could his absence be because he had a mediocre ipl and the availability heuristic kicked in all humans give in to the our tendency to make sense of the world through stories this is actually a necessity for how else can we navigate a complex world but we must beware of getting wedded to a false narrative for example let us say that kohli decides that rohit sharma has too much talent to be left out of the test side plays with the correct intent and must be persisted with i am not expressing a view on the merit of this particular narrative just using it as an example since it is a common criticism of kohli once kohli has picked this narrative he is wired to ignore all evidence against it and consider only all evidence that supports it this is called the defined as the tendency to search for interpret favor and recall information in a way that confirms one s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses you see this all the time among political and ideological tribes on twitter in the context of our example narrative it could mean that every time rohit derisively and unfairly called nohit by his detractors does well kohli says ah i knew it all along and every time he fails kohli shrugs it off as an aberration it becomes easy to do and explain rohit is failures by citing small sample sizes which is a reasonable argument in its own right a related tendency is the which is the finding that given evidence against their beliefs people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly so if rohit makes a quick cameo and gets out that could actually strengthen kohli s belief rather than weaken it the may have something to do with it this is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them in this case kohli would own the decision to persist with rohit and it would seem better to him than it actually is here are some other biases that could apply to this narrative the a proposed psychological phenomenon that a person who has already performed a favor for another is more likely to do another favor for the other than if they had received a favor from that person the a metaphor for the reflex like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms beliefs or paradigms do consider also the and the which i hardly need to define another factor that comes into play when sticking with a bad decision is the which can also be described as escalation of commitment this is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision action or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course an everyday example of this we buy a ticket to watch a movie hate the first half but do not walk out at the interval because hey the money we spent on the ticket will be wasted the correct approach is to view the ticket money as a sunk cost and optimise our enjoyment in the time to come but no there is this fallacy this might also lead to the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period it will happen less frequently in the future an example you flip an evenly weighted coin three times and each time it lands on tails so you feel that heads is due and the next one will surely be heads the probability remains for any individual spin of the coin because coins do not have a memory similarly a batsman s chances of succeeding in the next innings are what they are past failures does not mean that a success is due kohli might also suffer from the a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual communicating with other individuals unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand is it possible for example that he unfairly expects less talented players like pujara and ajinkya rahane to bat at a similar strike rate to him because he himself knows how to bat at a healthy momentum and has the skill to do so even if he does his teammates are unlikely to dissent too much which might lead to the the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them this would ensure that he gets no negative feedback from within the team what about from outside well indian captains have a tradition of ignoring the media which a smart thing to do these days given the quality of it but could kohli also be giving in to the the tendency to interpret others behaviors as having hostile intent even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign i could go on forever but you get the drift the purpose of this piece is not to criticize kohli or even the individuals mentioned in the example such as poor rohit nohit who was finally removed from the test side when it all got too much we are all hardwired with these cognitive biases we would all improve our decision making if we were aware of them our quest as humans always is to transcend ourselves kohli has done this as a batsman and i hope he manages to do it as a captain by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india remember remember the sixth of september in many ways this date in is as momentous as august was on that day india gained freedom from a foreign ruler but indians remained unfree subjects of an oppressive indian state instead of an oppressive colonial one we were denied so many types of freedom and took that condition for granted this week though an important sliver of liberty was finally handed to us this is also independence day the repeal of section is an emotional victory but the tears are bittersweet the fact remains that it took five unelected men to set this right in this great democracy of ours where the voice of the people is supposed to find expression in its politics not one political party in the last years tried to repeal parties do not have principles only incentives and all of them behaved this way because they feared that voters would not approve that tells you what every gay person in this country already knows from lived experience our society is homophobic not just that our society and the state do not give a damn about consent the central principle of this judgement was consent no one has the right to come between two consenting adults consent is the foundation of all human rights and should be the foundation of our republic and yet despite this one historic judgement on one domain of consent we remain a land that does not care for this principle consider the arts we are a country where films made for adults by adults are routinely censored books are banned objectionable art exhibitions are shut down or vandalised artists and patrons consenting adults all are prevented from enriching each other consider free speech as in any other marketplace all of us benefit when there is competition in the marketplace of ideas and yet we have laws in the indian penal code like a and a which allow anyone to claim offence and shut free speech down like these laws are colonial artefacts but they are actually validated by the most illiberal part of our constitution article which allows caveats to free speech on grounds like public order and decency and morality those are open to interpretation and anything goes consider food the government regulates what you may or may not eat consider health you cannot take cannabis for medical use or any other medicine not approved by a government body consider education you could get arrested for home schooling your children if you find government schools inadequate and there are so many restrictions placed on private schools that come between consenting parents and consenting teachers indeed markets are as big a battleground for consent as bedrooms or kitchens if we do not interfere between consenting adults in a bedroom or kitchen what moral justification is there for doing so in the marketplace every time a voluntary exchange happens between two people it does so because both people benefit life and markets are a positive sum game and yet governments regulate and stop voluntary exchanges between consenting adults all the time often acting on behalf of entrenched interests they restrict competition harming consumers aka citizens and benefiting cronies the most poignant victims of this are our farmers our entire agricultural crisis is a result of our farmers having their autonomy snatched away from them they are the least free of indians and are trapped in a cycle of dependency but this is a subject for another column perhaps years after the british left is we have the mentality of the colonised we behave as if we are subjects of a mai baap state and not its masters the state should exist to serve us not the other way around we give the state a monopoly on violence so that it can protect our rights not so that it takes them away with the threat of violence it is not a safeguard for our liberty but the biggest threat to it we got lucky this time with the supreme court ruling but we cannot rely on the court every time there are too many freedoms to fight for and unless the parties that run this country see political capital in it they will not grant us those freedoms but i have hope the outpouring of joy at the repeal of may indicate that things are changing have we started caring about each other and about freedom a little bit more are we beginning to recognise that a nation cannot truly be free until all its citizens are free are we going to bring about more trysts with destiny by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a debate has been conducted in india since the kerala floods broke not through words but through actions two different ideas of india are being debated they are opposite ideas and we will soon be called upon to choose one of them to get a sense of the first idea consider the countless heroes who stepped up in kerala to help the countless victims as the water levels rose as homes were submerged and livelihoods destroyed fisherfolk from across the state turned their boats inwards to help the most enduring image jaisal kp a fisherman from mallapuram bending and offering his back as a ramp for rescued people getting on a boat thousands of volunteers from across the country even as far away as kashmir turned up to volunteer at relief camps those locals who escaped the worst of it stopped their onam shopping to buy relief materials instead thousands donated to the chief minister s relief fund including an eight year girl who had been saving for four years to buy a bicycle she donated every rupee in the town of suntikoppa the local church temple and madarsa turned into relief camps coordinating with each other as if to say our religion is humanity what is this idea of india it is the idea that we are one people we celebrate our differences but we recognise that what holds us together is stronger than anything that pulls us apart in this india when the water level rises no one will ask what your religion caste language state cuisine or ideology is they will offer you their hand or their boat or their bicycle the other idea of india is filled with hate and anger one man claimed this was god s punishment on kerala because menstruating women had been allowed into the sabarimala temple another claimed that it was god s punishment on kerala s muslims and christians for well not being hindu another appeal went out for donations only to go to hindu organisations which would help only hindus there were those who wanted not only to gloat on kerala s misfortune but to prevent it from getting help a gentleman who was later revealed to be a member of the bjp it cell put out a viral video saying that since kerala did not have too many poor people there was no need to donate another man in an army uniform gave a similar message only for the army to then declare that the fellow was an imposter in all this the hindutva whatsapp factories were active they circulated images supposedly of rss people distributing relief though some of them turned out to be of non rss people including from the communist parties and the others were old recycled pictures will not help will not allow others to help will take credit anyway this was also the story of the central government when the kerala government asked for aid the narendra modi government gave a pittance a fraction of what had been asked for and what they had given other states for smaller tragedies when speculation spread that the uae government had offered rs crores as relief the modi government said it would not allow the money to go from willing donor to needy recipient yes really this is the second idea of india here we are divided by religion caste region language we feel schadenfreude not sympathy at the pain of others here it is a zero sum game and we like to see others fall as only their falling will help us rise i call this the tukde tukde vision of india people who think in terms of divisions who foment hate among their own peoplewhat else can one call them but anti national they are betraying both the inclusive entities they claim to speak for hinduism and india i consider them a greater threat to our nation than any terrorism from across the border it is true that all indian politics is identity politics every government we have ever had every party that exists today has let this nation down but this ruling party and the entire hindutva movement has hit new lows with the way they actively tried to prevent aid from reaching kerala such malice why the people they let down were not just the people of kerala but the citizens of india from across the country the rest of us were watching and deciding which of these two ideas of india is dear to us and just as this debate unfolded through actions we can make our choice clear through action vote wisely next year by amit varma in this is the first installment of politics without romance my monthly column with bloomberg quint as the name indicates this column will look at indian politics through the lens of public choice theory one more independence day comes up and it is time to ask that annual question again where have all the leaders gone it is a common lament that the politicians of today are the opposite of the freedom fighters who got us this independence we had giants then we have pygmies now our leaders then were driven by principle our leaders now are driven by the lust for power why if you look at politics through the lens of economics which i will do in this column over the new few months the answer lies in incentives why do people get into politics what do they want from it what can they realistically expect what do they need to do to get to the top what trade offs do they need to make what do they need to do to stay on top right from the th century our freedom fighters had little personal upside to their battles we were ruled by the british empire and these men had no chance of coming to power and enjoying its rewards the downside was significant though if you were in a position of influence you could lose it if you were not and fought too vigorously you could land up in jail or worse the generations of men and women who rose up to fight against the british empire did so because they were animated by a higher cause there was no personal upside to it there was a principle at stake for example freedom is my birthright and i shall have it and they cared about that principle so much that some of them were willing to die for it once independence was achieved the incentives changed firstly getting the british to leave was so miraculous coming after a decades long struggle that our leaders did not notice what we did not achieve yes we got political independence but we still were not guaranteed the personal and economic freedoms that we had fought for one of the seminal moments of our independence struggle was mahatma gandhi s protest against the tyranny of the salt tax well consider that the tax on salt is far higher today not to mention other taxes or other tyrannies here s what we did on august we replaced one set of rulers with another only the colour of their skin changed and those who had fought against those in power were now in power themselves their incentives changed would they change in the early years of our independence our politics was ruled by those who had come into the freedom struggle for the sake of principles not power i am willing to give them the benefit of doubt their mistakes were honest mistakes such as the embrace of the fabian socialism that kept india poor for decades longer than it should have that flawed thinking was the fashion of the times and was not driven by bad incentives the drive towards big government did however change incentives further henceforth it was natural that those who would be drawn to politics would be driven by the lust for power now that it was possible for indians to join the ruling class people were bound to want to do so now that we had achieved independence there no longer seemed a burning need to fight for higher principles principles would become a rationalisation a way to position a political brand to differentiate it from others those who did enter politics for reasons of principle would soon find themselves having to compromise on those principles for pragmatic reasons so much so that by the time they actually achieved power there could be no trace of those original principles there is an old truism that power corrupts it is equally true that the quest for power corrodes character there may be politicians who start off idealisticbut they cannot remain that way no matter what their public positioning why is this incentives achieving power requires two things money and votes as you can only get votes by spending money this is arguably one thing but i will speak of them as two to illustrate the different directions that politicians are pulled in first money over the decades it has gotten more and more prohibitive to fight an election one needs crores to contest even a local election where does this money come from who can afford such large sums the money always comes from interest groups who expect a return on investment there is always a quid pro quo involved i give you money but when you come to power you do xyz for me first money leads to power then power must lead to money this is the chakravyuh of politics for example if a big industrialist gives a political party money what could he want out of it one he may want regulation that protects his industry or company from competition place tariffs on foreign goods deny a license to a competitor and so on all these can be done citing seemingly noble principles two he may want special privileges that the government using its monopoly on violence can get him for example if he wants land for a factory the government can use eminent domain to get it cheaply from villagers and hand it to him three he may want soft loans from a public sector bank which he otherwise may not get from a private sector bank that has different incentives and does due diligence contemporary examples of this abound consider the interest groups that benefit from any government policy and you can follow the trail you may oppose fdi in retail for example because small traders form a large chunk of your donor base as is the case with aap and the bjp until recently you may allocate natural resources to favoured cronies as the upa was alleged to have done with coal and spectrum all of these you will note amount to a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich from us citizens to moneybag interest groups this is how power provides roi to money needless to say you do not make money only for those who fund you but also for yourself this might even be the prime personal incentive for wannabe politicians our system of big government is especially lucrative wherever there is power there is discretion and there will be corruption and our government is designed to give enormous amounts of power to those in charge which makes immense corruption inevitable this is not a function of the party in power but of the incentives in play and now to votes in our democracy elections are the process by which we decide which of the competing mafias will get to rule us for five years there is just one way for these mafias to win our votes by bribing us the party in power may hand out immediate sops the parties in opposition will promise them in the political marketplace just as in any other marketplace every brand does not try to woo every customer unlike in a regular marketplace of course there is usually only one winner parties will have vote banks that they will nurture over time and reward when they are in power the immense power of the state makes patronage politics lucrative for example you can promise reservations in government jobs to a group of your choice or even without explicit promises you can make sure the state favours the groups you are wooing either by giving them jobs or contracts or looking after them in other ways this is analogous to how a mafia rewards and protects those who give them hafta except here it is legal or you can just bribe them directly with free biryani or pressure cookers this can become a vicious circle for example everyone wants farmers votes and once one party promises farm loan waivers every other party has to follow suit loan waivers are a temporary anaesthetic that perpetuate the problem but politicians do not have the incentives to make the deep structural changes that are required in agriculture those will take years to play out much beyond an election cycle and parties need votes now the great tragedy of indian politics is that all our politics is identity politics that centres around state patronage all parties are guilty of this smaller regional parties nurture their own caste vote banks the congress pandered to minorities for decades the bjp caters to the worst bigots among us and there are enough of them now to make the party a force they also manipulated the caste politics of up masterfully in and as for aap they have pandered to khalistanis and kanwariyas alike and a prominent supporter of theirs was made to apologize to a jain muni for the reason that jains were a powerful vote bank for aap all this is inevitable what can a party do without votes what can a party do without money the imperatives of our democracy make politics morally corrosive to get to power you must privilege the means over the ends and even if your ends were noble to begin with by the time you are done your only goal is power you become the monster you might have tried to fight what could change this well if the state had less power it would offer less roi to investors there would be less money and less patronage for parties to bribe voters with imagine a limited government that existed just to protect our rights and nothing else the incentives would change it would have so little power that those who lust for power would be forced to look elsewhere for career options maybe they would join the mafia interest groups would stop funding politicians because politicians would not have power to do something in return for them voters could not be induced with short term sops or goodies can that change in the design of our government ever take place who will have the incentives to make that change not the moneybags and the interest groups that is for sure but what about the voters if enough citizens demanded reform the government would have to listen supply has to obey demand andrew brietbart once said politics is downstream of culture this is exactly right before we change our politics we must change our culture this is as noble a battle to fight as the one our great freedom fighters fought against the british empire decades ago will new leaders emerge to fight it by amit varma in this is the first installment on a cricket column i have started for cricket next in which i will write about cricket from the lens of other disciplines such as economics psychology game theory etc during his second innings in the lord s test virat kohli could be seen grimacing and a nation grimaced with him kohli has a chronic back problem the rest of the country has a chronic cricket problem why cannot our batsmen play the swinging ball in test matches in england why did this particular lot look so incapable why are they worse at this than previous generations can an asteroid please give us deliverance by hitting earth wiping humanity out and ending this pain i am both a cricket tragic and an india tragic and i will make three tragic arguments in this piece one indian batsmen of the future will be even worse against the swinging ball in england two it does not matter because test cricket is dying and there will not be any test matches in england years from now three that also does not matter because cricket will flourish nevertheless and other forms of the game have as much drama and nuance as test cricket does if in different ways this may sound dismal to you so its apt that i make my argument through the lens of the allegedly dismal science of economics in particular i want to look at incentives what are the incentives of those who view the game play the game and run the game how is their behaviour moulded by these incentives what are the implications of this first up consider the concept of opportunity cost which put simply refers to what alternative uses you could have made of the time or money you spent on something the opportunity cost of watching a test match for example is what else you could have done with the five days you spent watching it this boils down to the options available for your time for most of cricket s existence there have not been that many alternatives there is a cliche about cricket and bollywood being the two great th century passions of india but think about it what else did you have for entertainment not much television and no internet facebook whatsapp youtube netflix or easily available porn that has changed today we are inundated with options of what to do with our time that means that the opportunity cost of watching a test match has shot up and our incentive for doing so has declined most cricket purists i know do not actually spend much time watching test cricket look up another concept from economics revealed preferences the tv ratings of test cricket have been plummeting and if not for the subsidy from other forms of the game there would already be no commercial reason for the game to exist what is remarkable about test cricket is that it exists at all most other popular sports can be viewed in easy to digest nuggets football lasts minutes not nine hours tennis matches hockey games badminton encounters can all be done with within an evening and because there is no longer form of the game to compare these sports to no one complains about how they lack drama or depth i believe that we complain about twenty cricket because test matches came first so we put that on a pedestal and consider that the basis of comparison another economic concept to look up the anchoring effect had t s come first we might have viewed test cricket through a different prism of values and found it wanting use the tools of economics on a t game each team is given as many resources players as in a test or a one day match but far less overs only to play an innings in this relative scarcity of overs changes the value of all the resources a dot ball becomes more expensive for the batting side as every ball carries more value a wicket has less value than in an odi as your batting resources need to be spread out over only overs rather than the risk reward ratio changes and the value of aggression goes up this changes the incentives for batting sides aggression is rewarded the value of building an innings goes down and to finish an innings with batsmen still waiting in the pavilion counts as a waste of resources opportunity cost again batsmen thus have to innovate far more and find new ways of playing the game consider the much touted degree game of ab de villiers there invention came out of necessity the new format making demands on batsmen to expand their repertoire abd is just the most spectacular player around many other batsmen started practising new strokes playing them reflexively expanding not just their repertoire but also the orthodoxy who is to say that the reverse sweep and the ramp shot do not now belong in batting textbooks contrary to a popular canard bowlers did not turn into bowling machines their response to more aggressive batsmen was more deception and not just by bowling more slower balls and wide yorkers spinners actually began flighting the ball more inviting batsmen to hit them like back in the romanticized days of yore think back on the bowling of the spinners like rashid khan kuldeep yadav and yuzvendra chahal in the last ipl the flight the loop the aggressive intent bowlers figured out that one way to counter the momentum of a batting side was to take wickets attack became the best defence this might seem contradictory on one hand the value of a wicket goes down for a batsmen because runs are more important on the other hand the value of a wicket goes up for a bowler because it can slow a batting side s momentum so how much do wickets matter questions like this make it a fascinating time to be a cricket lover there is an ongoing conversation between batsmen and bowlers with both innovating new skills as they test this hypothesis or that this is why watching the ipl is so eye opening and mind boggling a game is evolving in front of our eyes its grammar and structure its mores and norms through a conversation between batsmen and bowlers and captains that we get to see in real time if you love cricket how can you not be enthralled now consider how the incentives change for everyone concerned viewers prefer t s to tests because the opportunity cost of watching a t game is far less besides it is an incredibly rich experience having that added dramatic element of urgency that tests do not have because of this there is more money to be made excelling in this shorter form of the game so players are incentivised to optimise for it every minute that a batsman spends expanding his repertoire of aggressive strokes though carries the opportunity cost of not practising for test match skills such as how to leave a swinging ball the inevitable outcome of this is that batsmen will always train to play t s and will be unequipped for those specialised skills that test matches demand especially test matches in england india tours england once every few years why should kl rahul who i consider a batting genius spend much time preparing for conditions he will encounter so infrequently another indication of how these incentives play out only cheteshwar pujara bothered to go to england early and prepare for this tour he did so only because he has been discarded in the other forms of the game incentives contrast this with the fact that the indian batsmen of the generation immediately preceding the ipl era the dravid tendulkar ganguly generation all played county cricket but why should kl rahul or rishabh pant bother with that it is not fair to make a value judgement about this all these players have made rational choices responding to incentives who is to say that one specific balance between bat and ball is better than some other balance who is to say that test cricket is superior to one day cricket even many who do state that as a personal preference do not actually put their eyeballs where their mouths are people who love test cricket as i do can take succour in the fact that the cricket boards will keep the form alive even when it is no longer commercially viable by subsidising it from income that comes from shorter formats but for how long will this posturing be necessary when the year old of today is years old who will care for test cricket especially if that kid is an indian viewer who watched this lord s test and thought to himself ya whatever why even bother by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india there was outrage on twitter this week when it was revealed that the union government had since on government advertising the outrage is justifiedbut it is not enough it is not just this amount or this use of government money that we should question but the whole concept of government spending and indeed government action we in india seem to think of government as the solution to all our problems i often argue that india s biggest religion is not hinduism but the religion of government we behave as if the state is a benevolent entity with unlimited resources of its own with which it should fulfil all our wishes ban what we do not like build what we want built spend on what we think are good causes statues loan waivers awards for sportspeople ministries for cow protection and so on in all this we ignore one essential truth every act of government is an act of violence think about what the state needs in order to exist our taxes money taken from us by force no one pays taxes willingly without the threat of imprisonmentbasically abduction by the one entity that has a monopoly on violencethere would be no taxpayers there are two words that mean the act of taking someone s property without their consent no wonder people say that taxation is theft indeed it is more than that assume that you pay of your income in taxes that amounts to one fourth of your time and labour it means that for all practical purposes from january to march every year you are a slave to the state taxation is not just theft it is part time slavery contrary to a common canard everybody pays taxes taxes are not just income tax your domestic help is parted from her money when she buys a bar of soap the beggar at the traffic signal near you loses money to the government every time he buys salt even inflationusually caused by the government printing moneyis basically a tax on the poor i am not arguing that we should pay no taxes and live in anarchy the state is a necessary evil we need it to protect our rights and there is no way around the paradox that by allowing it to exist we give away some of our rights the state has to tax us to protect us and the violence it thus commits is necessary to protect us from greater violence regardless of what your ideology may be none of what i have said above is contestable it is plain fact that no one pays taxes willingly and that the threat of coercion is involved it is plain fact thus that every government action involves violence and coercion most people would also accept that some amount of this violence is necessary for we need the state to protect our rights the larger question then is what actions of the state are justified given the violence involved at every step this is where ideology begins person one a libertarian like me could argue for a minimal state that only protects our rights and nothing else if you feel the state should do other things give me the moral justification for your preferences being funded by money coercively taken from others person two may advocate a state looking after its less fortunate members proving free healthcare and education person three may care about national glory and want to build grand statues person four could argue that building infrastructure is necessary and has positive externalities it is beside the point of course that political parties are driven by imperatives beyond ideology they need money and votes to exist and win and when in power use the state as a tool to reward those who gave them money and votesalways at the expense of us citizens the purpose of this column is not to argue for or against any of those ideologies i just ask that every time you advocate government action of any kind remember that the action comes at a cost that cost is not just a financial cost but a moral one that cost involves violence committed on all of usnot just rich industrialists but also the poorest of the poor can you justify that violence by amit varma in this is the th installment of rhyme and reason my weekly set of limericks for the

varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india would aditi mittal have become a stand up comedian had she not studied in a girls college appearing as a guest in of my weekly podcast she told me that studying at sophia college enabled her to perform in front of others with confidence had there been boys in her class she said she would not have been able to claim the space of the class jester this came as a revelation to me though it should not have no male comedian would have experienced this but every woman knows what it is like aditi s point was that even though she was so privilegedborn to english speaking liberal parentsshe began her career facing obstacles her male peers never considered at least she made it through there are million people who did not one reason for india being such a poor country is that we treat half of our greatest resourceour peopleas inferior to the other half this has a huge cost which people have recently begun to quantify here are some numbers only of indian women are in the workforce next only to saudi arabia among g countries in the latest issue of the economist reveals that if female labour participation was as much as of that of men there would be an additional million women in the workforce even many of those who do work now would be more skilled and productive if treated equally with their brothers in childhood according to a mckinsey study our gdp could go up by by if female participation in the workforce matched that of men for more read in indiaspend india s misogyny carries much more than just an economic cost it is a humanitarian tragedy no other term suffices when more than half a billion people are treated as subhuman and prevented from reaching their full potential a recent study named india as the most dangerous country in the world for women which is no surprise given that women are essentially treated as the property of men these cultural attitudes are that take this approach even though we live in the st century our attitudes towards women belong in the th we must fix this let me declare it upfront i am a feminist and because that particular f word has so many shades of meaning let me define what i mean by it feminism is the belief that women deserve the same respect as individuals that men do the same moral consideration the same legal rights my feminism arises out of my belief in the primacy of individual rights with consent as an absolute value indeed i tell my fellow libertarians that to be libertarian is by default to be feminist a male friend of mine even says if you are not feminist you are not a good human being why does feminism get a bad rap then this is because just as there are all kinds of human beings there are all kinds of feminists not all stop at the principle of equal rights and offshoots of feminism can often contradict each other google gender feminism vs equity feminism many feminists feed into an identity politics in vogue today which can be as toxic as the ills it purports to be fighting also the tactics that some feminists employ can make some uncomfortable such as the recent list of alleged sexual offenders in academia who were to be deemed guilty until proven innocent but even that list had an important function which is the same one that the metoo movement highlights women are angry and will not put up with this shit any more men seem to be oblivious to the extent and ubiquity of this anger as well as to the fact that it is justified indeed one central cultural disconnect of our times can be summed up like this women are angry men are clueless this is made worse by the fact that many men who declare themselves to be feminists are just being performative basically virtue signalling to get laid as men are hardwired to do i find this irritating but i will not turn away from declaring my feminism either because of this or because of my discomfort with the tactics of some feminists the reason for this is twofold one women being treated as second class citizens hurts us all and diminishes us as human beings two it is a sad truth that because of the power dynamics around us men can actually make more of a difference than women can especially when outspoken women are being constantly minimised and mocked therefore it is imperative for us men to also fight this good fight not because of what our ancestors did or how our fellow men behave but because it is the right thing to do also check out episode of the seen and the unseen episode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the

bhakts to stop trolling me by amit varma in this is the seventh installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india all around me the air is filled with the anguished groans of cricket purists england scored against australia a few days ago in a one day match at trent bridge despite a slowdown in which no boundaries were hit in the last four overs in their previous odi at the venue against pakistan they had made and it is not just this venue everywhere it would seem mishits are going for six record scores are being posted and bowlers are settling down in bathtubs to slash their wrists the purist lament is simple for a variety of reasons the balance between bat and ball has been upset heavier bats shorter boundaries bad regulations the malign influence of twenty cricket in the good old days my friends declaim in sophisticated accents cricket was not a spectacle but a contest also though they do not say this petrol was two rupees a litre as these notional nostalgics collapse at my feet i want not to console them but to whack them on their unhelmeted heads yes cricket has changed i want to tell them but it has changed for the better get over yourself go watch a game first up let us consider why the balance of the game has shifted towards run scoring heavier bats are just part of the reason the main cause is that batsmen have been forced to develop new skills because of the changed imperatives of t cricket having ten wickets in hand but only balls in an innings means that the value of a run goes up the value of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball is immense this mandates greater aggression batsmen have thus developed a wider array of skills than previous generations needed to consider ab devillier s degree game fielders are now better than ever in the past because each run saved is that much more important and bowlers have also adapted that old cliche of t cricket being a slugfest where you can replace bowlers with bowling machines is nonsense bowlers who once focussed on restricting runs have realised that the best way to keep the score down is to take wickets attack is the best defence modern spinners like rashid chahal kuldeep are not scared to flight the ball in search of wickets in contrast to the flat odi spin bowling of the past the top teams in this latest ipl were the ones who bowled to take wickets not to restrict consider how ms dhoni used his csk fast bowlers these skills have migrated to the other forms of the gameand have enriched them the writer gideon haigh once mentioned why he found the odi world cup fascinating you got test match quality bowlingbecause the only way to slow down batsmen these days is to get them outand t batting skills that illustrates how the game has evolved into a deeper more complex beastwhich is a good thing and yes in all this the balance between bat and ball has shifted but why was the older balancesay from the s when was a good score in a over odibetter in any way is it because that is the one we are used to and which forms our comfort zone and anchors our expectations here s a thought experiment if t cricket had been invented before test cricket and tests came later how would people have responded would we wonder what the point of five day cricket was without the challenging constraint of having a limited number of balls to score your runs in another thought experiment if someone introduced a five day baseball game or a nine hour football game how would people react to them would they immediately diss the shorter form beyond the skills argument there is also a pragmatic reason to celebrate t cricket few people even performative purists have five days to watch a game of cricket these days or even one whole day there are just too many other claimants for your time cricket was heading for commercial death when this new form came to the rescue long enough to pack in immense drama short enough to finish in an evening in future t s will end up subsidising test cricket and keeping it alive indeed i celebrate t cricket not because i like it more than test cricket they are different sports requiring different skills and i find it graceless when fans of one sport disparage another i celebrate it because t s have enhanced tests by bringing new skills and strategic learnings into the game and they will keep tests alive in commercial terms that is why every purist should celebrate twenty cricket by amit varma in this is the rd installment of rhyme and reason my weekly set of limericks for the sunday times of india edit page modiji s

installment of lighthouse my monthly column for blink a supplement of the hindu business line do not make your happiness dependent on other people and all will be well when i look back on my younger self the year old amit from years ago i feel alarmed there is just nothing he is doing right his outlook to life his ambitions his work ethic his food ethic his attitude towards other people they are all wrong he is obnoxious arrogant and delusional and it seems certain to me that this cannot end well i cannot reach out across time and warn that kid and he would not listen to me this is a common lament of middle aged people like me oh if we only knew then what we know now still i am lucky to get here and no longer be that guy i know similarly aged people who have not lost their youthful delusions and wake up every morning unhappy i feel bad for them but not too bad for reasons that will be obvious by the time you finish reading this this is the th edition of lighthouse and my last column in this space so in the spirit of a happy ending i want to bow out with a list of learnings here are a few things i learned along the way from being that guy to this guy one you are not special you are one of over seven billion people on this planet which is one of billion planets in the milky way which is one of billion galaxies in the known universe so forget what the self help books tell you you are not unique or different in any way you are one accounting error of genetic composition away from a gorilla and everything you are is a result of luck the genes you happened to have and the environment you were born and raised in this is not a bad thing in fact it should be a relief two you are not entitled to anything i am shocked sometimes to see how entitled some young millennials feel till i remember that in my time we felt as entitled this is a quality of youth and the natural consequence of thinking you are special which we are hardwired to do for how else would we live but the world owes you nothing and the more entitled you feel the more you will be disappointed if you feel entitled to nothing on the other hand everything good that comes your way will feel like a delightful bonus three stop looking for validation our lives can be dominated by the need for the approval or admiration of others this is foolish for one simple reason others do not give a shit and are caught up in their own corresponding anxiety they are not thinking of you all the time you are only the center of your own universe so stop caring about what others think of you it does not matter unless you take it seriously in which case you are doomed to unhappiness as you will be sweating over what you cannot control four focus only on what you can control one sure route to be unhappy is to make your happiness dependent on things you cannot control you will then feel helpless and exhausted as you are buffeted by the winds of chance instead you should only feel good or bad about events in your immediate control the rest is what it is if you take the route that there is no free will you could even achieve a buddhist sort of complete equanimity or you could just panic leave that aside for now five focus on process not outcome this follows on from the last lesson you cannot control the outcome but you can control the process the happiest writers are those who take joy in the writing not in the awards or the money if you are stressed about outcomes you will spend your whole life stressed because outcomes are never satisfactory and when we do get what we want we immediately revise our expectations if you just take joy in the simple act of work and leave aside the results much of the stress in your life will just vanish six focus on the positives i know people consumed by negativity who wake up every morning angry and bitter that the world has not given them their due they are the sole cause of their unhappiness the world is full of things that can make you either happy or unhappy focus on the positives this creates a virtuous feedback loop you feel better and work better when you do this and that creates even more joy for yourself cut everything that is toxic and negative out of your life including people who are always cribbing life is too short to spend it sunk in despair some might argue that it is because life is short that we spend it sunk in despair but you cannot control that seven happiness lies in small things what makes you happy if you make it dependent on the fulfillment of big dreams or the actions of others you will be chasing an elusive goal the biggest lesson i have learnt is that happiness lies in small things the rich taste of strong coffee on a rainy day a few moments of laughter with friends or loved ones getting lost in a book or transported by a song or giving in to the magic of a film look around you and i am sure you will find many things that make you feel blessed what else do you need why by amit varma in deserves to

       "  'wireless networking wi fi has made it so easy for anyone to use internet on your computer mobile phones tablets and other wireless devices anywhere in the house without the clutter of cables with traditional wired networks it is extremely difficult for someone to steal your bandwidth but the big problem with wireless signals is that others can access the internet using your broadband connection even while they are in a neighboring building or sitting in a car that is parked outside your apartment this practice also known as piggybacking is bad for three reasons what do the bad guys use there have been quite a few instances where innocent internet users have been arrested for sending hate emails when in reality their email accounts where hacked though the unsecured wi fi networks that they had at home is a free packet sniffing tool for linux mac and windows that can scan traffic flowing though a wireless network including cookies forms and other http requests the good news is that it is not very hard to make your wireless network secure which will both prevent others from stealing your internet and will also prevent hackers from taking control of your computers through your own wireless network here a few simple things that you should to secure your wireless network first you need to know how to access your wireless router s settings usually you can do this by typing in into your web browser and then enter the correct user name and password for the router this is different for each router so first check your router s user manual you can also use google to find the manuals for most routers online in case you lost the printed manual that came with your router purchase for your reference here are direct links to the manufacturer s site of some popular router brands once you have logged into your router the first thing you should do to secure your network is to change the default password of the router to something more secure this will prevent others from accessing the router and you can easily maintain the security settings that you want you can change the password from the administration settings on your router s settings page the default values are generally admin password what do the bad guys use this is a of default usernames and passwords of wireless routers modems switches and other networking equipment for instance anyone can easily make out from the database that the factory default settings for linksys equipment can be accessed by using admin for both username and password fields the ssid or wireless network name of your wireless router is usually pre defined as default or is set as the brand name of the router e g linksys although this will not make your network inherently more secure changing the ssid name of your network is a good idea as it will make it more obvious for others to know which network they are connecting to this setting is usually under the basic wireless settings in your router s settings page once this is set you will always be sure that you are connecting to the correct wireless network even if there are multiple wireless networks in your area do not use your name home address or other personal information in the ssid name also see what do the bad guys use wi fi scanning tools like windows and mac linux are free and they will allow anyone to find all the available wireless networks in an area even if the routers are not broadcasting their ssid name in order to prevent other computers in the area from using your internet connection you need to encrypt your wireless signals there are several encryption methods for wireless settings including wpa personal and wi fi protected access version wep is basic encryption and therefore least secure i e it can be easily cracked but is compatible with a wide range of devices including older hardware whereas wpa is the most secure but is only compatible with hardware manufactured to enable encryption on your wireless network open the wireless security settings on your router s configuration page this will usually let you select which security method you wish to choose if you have older devices choose wep otherwise go with wpa enter a passphrase to access the network make sure to set this to something that would be difficult for others to guess and consider using a combination of letters numbers and special characters in the passphrase what do the bad guys use and are some free tools that allow even non hackers to crack the wep wpa psk keys using dictionary or brute force techniques a suggests that aircrack may be easily used to break wifi encryption using a jail broken iphone or an ipod touch whether you have a laptop or a wi fi enabled mobile phone all your wireless devices have a unique this has nothing to do with an apple mac just like every computer connected to the internet has a unique ip address for an added layer of protection you can add the mac addresses of all your devices to your wireless router s settings so that only the specified devices can connect to your wi fi network mac addresses are hard coded into your networking equipment so one address will only let that one device on the network it is unfortunately possible to spoof a mac address but an attacker must first know one of the mac addresses of the computers that are connected to your wireless network before he can attempt spoofing to enable mac address filtering first make a list of all your hardware devices that you want to connect to your wireless network find their mac addresses and then add them to the mac address filtering in your router s administrative settings you can find the mac address for your computers by opening command prompt and typing in ipconfig all which will show your mac address beside the name physical address you can find the mac addresses of wireless mobile phones and other portable devices under their network settings though this will vary for each device what do the bad guys use someone can change the mac address of his or her own computer and can easily connect to your network since your network allows connection from devices that have that particular mac address anyone can determine the mac address of your device wireless using a sniffing tool like and he can then change the mac address of his own computer using another free tool like if your wireless router has a high range but you are staying in a small studio apartment you can consider decreasing the signal range by either changing the mode of your router to g instead of n or b or use a different wireless channel you can also try placing the router under the bed inside a shoe box or around the router antennas so that you can somewhat restrict the direction of signals apply the anti wi fi paint researchers a special wi fi blocking paint that can help you stop neighbors from accessing your home network without you having to set up encryption at the router level the paint contains chemicals that blocks radio signals by absorbing them by coating an entire room wi fi signals cannot get in and crucially cannot get out you should check the manufacturer s site occasionally to make sure that your router is running the latest firmware you can find the existing firmware version of your router using from the router s dashboard at to conclude mac address filtering with wpa aes encryption and a really complex passphrase is probably the best way to secure your wireless network once you have enabled the various security settings in your wireless router you need to add the new settings to your computers and other wireless devices so that they all can connect to the wi fi network you can select to have your computer automatically connect to this network so you will not have to enter the ssid passphrase and other information every time you connect to the internet your wireless network will now be a lot more secure and intruders may have a tough time intercepting your wi fi signals if you are worried that an outsider may be connecting to the internet using your wireless network try it is a free utility that will look for unexpected mac addresses on your wireless network as well as to dhcp requests another option is that you open your router s administration page using the address and look for the dhcp clients table it is under status local network on linksys routers here you will see a list of all computers and wireless devices that are connected to your home network it is also a good idea to turn off the router completely when you are not planning to use the computer for a longer period like when you are out shopping you save on electricity and the door remains shut for wireless piggybackers if you ever want to let a new device connect to your network you will have to find its mac address and add it to your router if you simple want to let a friend connect to your wireless network one time you can remove his mac address from the router settings when he or she

       "  'by category by date my first book my friend sancho was published in may and went on to become the biggest selling debut novel released that year in india it is a contemporary love story set in mumbai and had earlier for the man asian literary prize to learn more about the book if you are interested do join for my friend sancho for more about my publisher hachette india my posts on india uncut about my friend sancho can be found this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india back in the last decade i was a cricket journalist for a few years then around years ago i quit i was jaded as hell every game seemed like deja vu nothing new just another round on the treadmill although i would remember her fondly i thought me and cricket were done and then i fell in love again cricket has changed in the last few years in glorious ways there have been new ways of thinking about the game there have been new ways of playing the game every season new kinds of drama form new nuances spring up into sight this is true even of what had once seemed the dullest form of the game one day cricket we are entering into a brave new world and the team leading us there is england no matter what happens in the world cup final today a single game involves a huge amount of luck this england side are extraordinary they are the bridge between eras leading us into a golden age of cricket i know that sounds hyperbolic so let me stun you further by saying that i give the ipl credit for this and now having woken up you up with such a jolt on this lovely sunday morning let me explain twenty cricket changed the game in two fundamental ways both ended up changing one day cricket the first was strategy when the first t games took place teams applied an odi template to innings building pinch hit build slog but this was not an optimal approach in odis teams have players over overs in t s they have players over overs the equation between resources and constraints is different this means that the cost of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball goes up critically it means that the value of aggression rises a team need not follow the odi template in some instances attacking for all overs or as i call it frontloading may be optimal west indies won the t world cup in by doing just this and england played similarly and some sides began to realise was that they had been underestimating the value of aggression in one day cricket as well the second fundamental way in which t cricket changed cricket was in terms of skills the ipl and other leagues brought big money into the game this changed incentives for budding cricketers relatively few people break into test or odi cricket and play for their countries a much wider pool can aspire to play t cricket which also provides much more money so it makes sense to spend the hundreds of hours you are in the nets honing t skills rather than test match skills go to any nets practice and you will find many more kids practising innovative aggressive strokes than playing the forward defensive as a result batsmen today have a wider array of attacking strokes than earlier generations because every run counts more in t cricket the standard of fielding has also shot up and bowlers have also reacted to this by expanding their arsenal of tricks everyone has had to lift their game in one day cricket thus two things have happened one there is better strategic understanding about the value of aggression two batsmen are better equipped to act on the aggressive imperative the game has continued to evolve bowlers have reacted to this with greater aggression on their part and this ongoing dialogue has been fascinating the cricket writer gideon haigh once told me on my podcast that the world cup featured a battle between t batting and test match bowling this england team is the high watermark so far their aggression does not come from slogging they bat with a combination of intent and skills that allows them to coast at an over without needing to take too many risks in normal conditions thus they can coast to any hitting they do beyond that is the bonus that takes them to or it is a whole new level illustrated by the fact that at one point a few days ago they had seven consecutive scores of to their name look at their scores over the last few years in fact and it is clear that this is the greatest batting side in the history of one day cricket by a margin there have been stumbles in this world cup but in the bigger picture those are outliers if england have a bad day in the final and new zealand play their a game england might even lose today but if captain morgan s men play their a game they will coast to victory new zealand does not have those gears no other team in the world does for now but one day they will all have to learn to play like this by amit varma in this is the rd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india i had a strange dream last night i dreamt that the government had passed a law that made using laptops illegal i would have to write this column by hand i would also have to leave my home in mumbai to deliver it in person to my editor in delhi i woke up trembling and angry and realised how indian farmers feel every single day of their lives my column today is a tale of two satyagrahas both involve farmers technology and the freedom of choice one of them began this month but first let us go back to the turn of the millennium as the s came to an end cotton farmers across india were in distress pests known as bollworms were ravaging crops across the country farmers had to use increasing amounts of pesticide to keep them at bay the costs of the pesticide and the amount of labour involved made it unviable and often the crops would fail anyway then technology came to the rescue the farmers heard of bt cotton a genetically modified type of cotton that kept these pests away and was being used around the world but they were illegal in india even though no bad effects had ever been recorded well who cares about illegal when it is a matter of life and death farmers in gujarat got hold of bt cotton seeds from the black market and planted them you will never guess what happened next as began all cotton crops in gujarat failed except the hectares that had bt cotton the government did not care about the failed crops they cared about the illegal ones they ordered all the bt cotton crops to be destroyed it was time for a satyagraha and not just in gujarat the late sharad joshi leader of the shetkari sanghatana in maharashtra took around farmers to gujarat to stand with their fellows there they sat in the fields of bt cotton and basically said over our dead bodies joshi s point was simple all other citizens of india have access to the latest technology from all over they are all empowered with choice why should farmers be held back the satyagraha was successful the ban on bt cotton was lifted there are three things i would like to point out here one the lifting of the ban transformed cotton farming in india over of indian farmers now use bt cotton india has become the world s largest producer of cotton moving ahead of china according to agriculture expert ashok gulati india has gained us billion in the years since from higher exports and import savings because of bt cotton most importantly cotton farmers incomes have doubled two gmo crops have become standard across the world around million hectares of gmo crops have been planted worldwide and gmo foods are accepted in countries the humanitarian benefits have been massive golden rice a variety of rice packed with minerals and vitamins has prevented blindness in countless new born kids since it was introduced in the philippines three despite the fear mongering of some ngos whose existence depends on alarmism the science behind gmo is settled no harmful side effects have been noted in all these years and millions of lives impacted positively a couple of years ago over nobel laureates signed a petition asserting that gmo foods were safe and blasting anti science ngos that stood in the way of progress there is scientific consensus on this the science may be settled but the politics is not the government still bans some types of gmo seeds such as bt brinjal which was developed by an indian company called mahyco and used successfully in bangladesh more crucially a variety called ht bt cotton which fights weeds is also banned weeding takes up to of a farmer s time and often makes farming unviable farmers across the world use this variant of global cotton crops are ht bt indian farmers are so desperate for it that they choose to break the law and buy expensive seeds from the black market but the government is cracking down a farmer in haryana had his crop destroyed by the government in may on june this year a farmer named lalit bahale in the akola district of maharashtra kicked off a satyagraha by planting banned seeds of ht bt cotton and bt brinjal he was soon joined by thousands of farmers far from our urban eyes a heroic fight has begun our farmers already victimised and oppressed by a predatory government in countless ways are fighting for their right to take charge of their lives as this brave struggle unfolds i am left with a troubling question all those satyagrahas of the past by our great freedom fighters what were they for if all they got us was independence and not freedom by amit varma in this is the nd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india trade wars are on the rise and it is enough to get any nationalist all het up and excited earlier this week narendra modi s government that it would start imposing tariffs on us products starting today this is a response to similar treatment towards us from the us there is one thing i would invite you to consider trump and modi are not engaged in a war with each other instead they are waging war on their own people let us unpack that a bit part of the reason trump came to power is that he provided simple and wrong answers for people s problems he responded to the growing jobs crisis in middle america with two explanations one foreigners are coming and taking your jobs two your jobs are being shipped overseas both explanations are wrong but intuitive and they worked for trump he is stupid enough that he probably did not create these narratives for votes but actually believes them the first of those leads to the demonising of immigrants the second leads to a demonising of trade trump has acted on his rhetoric after becoming president and a modern us version of our old indira is india slogan might well be trump is tariff tariff is trump contrary to the fulminations of the economically illiterate all tariffs are bad without exception let me illustrate this with an example say there is a fictional product called brump a local brump costs rs foreign manufacturers appear and offer better brumps at a cheaper price say rs consumers shift to foreign brumps manufacturers of local brumps get angry and form an interest group they lobby the government or bribe it with campaign contributions to impose a tariff on import of brumps the government puts a rupee tariff the foreign brumps now cost rs and people start buying local brumps again this is a good thing right local businesses have been helped and local jobs have been saved but this is only the seen effect the unseen effect of this tariff is that millions of brump buyers would have saved rs per brump if there were no tariffs this money would have gone out into the economy been part of new demand generated more jobs everyone would have been better off and the overall standard of living would have been higher that brings to me to an essential truth about tariffs every tariff is a tax on your own people and every intervention in markets amounts to a distribution of wealth from the people at large to specific interest groups in other words from the poor to the rich the costs of this are dispersed and invisible what is rs to any of us and the benefits are large and worth fighting for local manufacturers of brumps can make crores extra much modern politics amounts to manufacturers of brumps buying politicians to redistribute money from us to them there are second order effects of protectionism as well when the us imposes tariffs on other countries those countries may respond by imposing tariffs back raw materials for many goods made locally are imported and as these become expensive so do those goods that quintessential american product the iphone uses parts from countries as local products rise in price because of expensive foreign parts prices rise demand goes down jobs are lost and everyone is worse off trump keeps talking about how he wants to win at trade but trade is not a zero sum game the most misunderstood term in our times is probably trade deficit a country has a trade deficit when it imports more than what it exports and trump thinks of that as a bad thing it is not i run a trade deficit with my domestic help and my local grocery store i buy more from them than they do from me that is fine because we all benefit it is a win win game similarly trade between countries is really trade between the people of both countries and people trade with each other because they are both better off to interfere in that process is to reduce the value created in their lives it is immoral to modify a slogan often identified with libertarians like me tariffs are theft these trade wars thus carry a touch of the absurd any leader who imposes tariffs is imposing a tax on his own people just see the chain of events trump taxes the american people in retaliation modi taxes the indian people trump raises taxes modi raises taxes nationalists in both countries cheer interests groups in both countries laugh their way to the bank what kind of idiocy is this how long will this lose lose game continue by amit varma in this is the st installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india when all political parties agree on something you know you might have a problem giriraj singh a minister in narendra modi s new cabinet that our population control law should become a movement this is something that would find bipartisan support we are taught from school onwards that india s population is a big problem and we need to control it this is wrong contrary to popular belief our population is not a problem it is our greatest strength the notion that we should worry about a growing population is an intuitive one the world has limited resources people keep increasing something s gotta give robert malthus made just this point in his book an essay on the principle of population he was worried that our population would grow exponentially while resources would grow arithmetically as more people entered the workforce wages would fall and goods would become scarce calamity was inevitable malthus s rationale was so influential that this mode of thinking was soon called malthusian it is a pejorative today a th century follower of his harrison brown came up with one of my favourite images on this subject arguing that a growing population would lead to the earth being covered completely and to a considerable depth with a writhing mass of human beings much as a dead cow is covered with a pulsating mass of maggots another malthusian paul ehrlich published a book called the population bomb in which began with the stirring lines the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now ehrlich was as you would guess a big supporter of india s coercive family planning programs i do not see he wrote how india could possibly feed two hundred million more people by none of these fears have come true a study by nicholas eberstadt called found no correlation between population density and poverty the greater the density of people the more you would expect them to fight for resources and yet monaco which has times the population density of bangladesh is doing well for itself so is bahrain which has three times the population density of india not only does population not cause poverty it makes us more prosperous the economist julian simon pointed out in a book that through history whenever there has been a spurt in population it has coincided with a spurt in productivity such as for example between malthus s time and now there were around a billion people on earth in and there are around billion today as you read these words consider that you are better off than the richest person on the planet then why is this the answer lies in the title of simon s book the ultimate resource when we speak of resources we forget that human beings are the finest resource of all there is no limit to our ingenuity and we interact with each other in positive sum ways every voluntary interactions leaves both people better off and the amount of value in the world goes up this is why we want to be part of economic networks that are as large and as dense as possible this is why most people migrate to cities rather than away from them and why cities are so much richer than towns or villages if malthusians were right essential commodities like wheat maize and rice would become relatively scarcer over time and thus more expensive but they have actually become much cheaper in real terms this is thanks to the productivity and creativity of humans who in eberstadt s words are in practice always renewable and in theory entirely inexhaustible the error made by malthus brown and ehrlich is the same error that our politicians make today and not just in the context of population zero sum thinking if our population grows and resources stays the same of course there will be scarcity but this is never the case all we need to do to learn this lesson is look at our cities this mistaken thinking has had savage humanitarian consequences in india think of the unborn millions over the decades because of our brutal family planning policies how many tendulkars rahmans and satyajit rays have we lost think of the immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country and finally think of the condescension of our politicians asserting that people are india s problem but always other people never themselves this arrogance is india s greatest problem not our people by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india amit shah s induction into the union cabinet is such an interesting moment even partisans who oppose the bjp as i do would admit that shah is a political genius under his leadership the bjp has become an electoral behemoth in the most complicated political landscape in the world the big question that now arises is this can shah do for india what he did for the bjp this raises a perplexing question in the last five years as the bjp has flourished india has languished and yet the leadership of both the party and the nation are more or less the same then why has not the ability to manage the party translated to governing the country i would argue that there are two reasons for this one the skills required in those two tasks are different two so are the incentives in play let us look at the skills first managing a party like the bjp is in some ways like managing a large multinational company shah is a master at top down planning and micro management the elections described in detail in prashant jha s book how the bjp wins should be a harvard business school case study the book describes how he fixed the bjp s ground game in uttar pradesh picking teams for booths in uttar pradesh monitoring them and keeping them accountable shah looked at the market segmentation in up and hit upon his now famous formula he realised he could not deliver the votes of muslims yadavs and jatavs who were of the population so he focussed on wooing the other including non yadav obcs and non jatav dalits he carried out versions of these caste reconfigurations across states and according to jha covered over lakh kilometres between and consolidating market share in every state in this country he nurtured a pool of a thousand new obc and dalit leaders going well beyond the posturing of other parties that so many dalits and obcs voted for the bjp in is astonishing shah went past mandal politics managing to subsume previously antagonistic castes and sub castes into a broad hindutva identity and as the bjp increased its depth it expanded its breadth as well what it has done in west bengal wiping out the left and weakening mamata banerjee is jaw dropping with hindsight it may one day seem inevitable but only a madman could have conceived it and only a genius could have executed it good man to be home minister then eh not quite a country is not like a large company or even a political party it is much too complex to be managed from the top down and a control freak is bound to flounder the approach needed is very different some tasks of governance it is true are tailor made for efficient managers building infrastructure taking care of roads and power building toilets even without an underlying drainage system and pr campaigns can all be executed by good managers but the deeper tasks of making an economy flourish require a different approach they need a light touch not a heavy hand the th century is full of cautionary tales that show that economies cannot be centrally planned from the top down examples of that fatal conceit to use my hero friedrich hayek s term include the soviet union mao s china and even the lady modi most reminds me of indira gandhi the task of the state when it comes to the economy is to administer a strong rule of law and to make sure it is applied equally no special favours to cronies or special interest groups just unleash the natural creativity of the people and do not try to micro manage sadly the bjp s impulse like that of most governments of the past is a statist one india should have a small state that does a few things well instead we have a large state that does many things badly and acts as a parasite on its people as it happens the few things that we should do well are all right up shah s managerial alley for example the rule of law is effectively absent in india today especially for the poor as home minister shah could fix this if he applied the same zeal to governing india as he did to growing the bjp but will he and here we come to the question of incentives what drives amit shah maximising power or serving the nation what is good for the country will often coincide with what is good for the party but not always when they diverge which path will shah choose so much rests on that by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a friend of mine was very impressed by the interview narendra modi granted last week to akshay kumar such a charming man such great work ethic he gushed he is the kind of uncle i would want my kids to have and then in the same breath he asked how can such a good man be such a bad prime minister i do not want to be uncharitable and suggest that modi s image is entirely manufactured so let us take the interview at face value let us also grant modi his claims about the purity of his neeyat intentions and reframe the question this way when it comes to public policy why do good intentions often lead to bad outcomes to attempt an answer i will refer to a story a friend of mine who knows modi well once told me about him modi was chilling with his friends at home more than a decade ago and told them an incident from his childhood his mother was ill once and the young narendra was tending to her the heat was enervating so the boy went to the switchboard to switch on the fan but there was no electricity my friend said that as he told this story modi s eyes filled with tears even after all these years he was moved by the memory my friend used this story to make the point that modi s vision of the world is experiential if he experiences something he understands it when he became chief minister of gujarat he made it his stated mission to get reliable electricity to every part of gujarat no doubt this was shaped by the time he flicked a switch as a young boy and the fan did not budge similarly he has given importance to things like roads and cleanliness since he would have experienced the impact of those as a young man my term for him inspired by rajat kapoor s film is the ankhon dekhi prime minister at one level this is a good thing he sees a problem and works for the rest of his life to solve it but what of things he cannot experience the economy is a complex beast as is society itself and beyond a certain level you need to grasp abstract concepts to understand how the world works you cannot experience them for example spontaneous order or the idea that society and markets like language cannot be centrally directed or planned or the positive sum nature of things which is the engine of our prosperity the idea that every transaction is a win win game and that for one person to win another does not have to lose or indeed respect for individual rights and free speech one understands abstract concepts by reading about them understanding them applying them to the real world modi is not known to be a reader and this is not his fault given his background it is a near miracle that he has made it this far he was not born into a home with a reading culture and did not have either the resources or the time when he was young to devote to reading the only way he could learn about the world thus was by experiencing it there are two lessons here one for modi himself and others in his position and another for everyone the lesson in this for modi is a lesson for anyone who rises to such an important position even if he is the smartest person in the world that lesson is to have humility about the bounds of your knowledge and to surround yourself with experts who can advise you well be driven by values and not confidence in your own knowledge gather intellectual giants around you and stand on their shoulders modi did not do this in the case of demonetisation which he carried out against the advice of every expert he consulted we all know the damage it caused to the economy the other learning from this is for all of us how do we make sense of the world by connecting dots an ankhon dekhi approach will get us very few dots and our view of the world will be blurred and incomplete the best way to gather more dots is reading the more we read the better we understand the world and the better the decisions we take when we can experience a thousand lives through books why restrict ourselves to one a good man with noble intentions can make bad decisions with horrible consequences the only way to hedge against this is by staying humble and reading more so when you finish reading this piece think of an unread book that you would like to read today and read it by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the man who gave us our national anthem rabindranath tagore once wrote that nationalism was a great menace he went on to say it is the particular thing which for years has been at the bottom of india s troubles not just india s but the world s in his book the open society and its enemies published in as adolf hitler was defeated karl popper ripped into nationalism with all its appeals to our tribal instincts to passion and to prejudice and to our nostalgic desire to be relieved from the strain of individual responsibility which it attempts to replace by a collective or group responsibility nationalism is resurgent today stomping across the globe hand in hand with populism in india too it is tearing us apart but must nationalism always be a bad thing a provocative new book by the israeli thinker yael tamir argues otherwise in her book why nationalism tamir makes the following arguments one nation states are here to stay two the state needs the nation to be viable three people need nationalism for the sense of community and belonging it gives them four therefore we need to build a better nationalism which brings people together instead of driving them apart the first point needs no elaboration we are a globalised world but we are also trapped by geography and circumstance only percent of the world s population tamir points out lives outside their country of birth nutopia the borderless state dreamed up by john lennon and yoko ono is not happening anytime soon if the only thing that citizens of a state have in common is geographical circumstance it is not enough if the state is a necessary construct a nation is its necessary justification political institutions crave to form long term political bonding writes tamir and for that matter they must create a community that is neither momentary nor meaningless nationalism she says endows the state with intimate feelings linking the past the present and the future more pertinently tamir argues people need nationalism i am a humanist with a belief in individual rights but tamir says that this is not enough the term human is a far too thin mode of delineation she writes individuals need to rely on thick identities to make their lives meaningful this involves a shared past a common culture and distinctive values tamir also points out that there is a strong correlation between social class and political preferences the privileged elites can afford to be globalists but those less well off are inevitably drawn to other narratives that enrich their lives rather than seeing nationalism as the last refuge of the scoundrel writes tamir we should start thinking of nationalism as the last hope of the needy tamir s book bases its arguments on the west but the argument holds in india as well in a country with so much poverty is it any wonder that nationalism is on the rise the cosmopolitan globe trotting elites do not have daily realities to escape but how are those less fortunate to find meaning in their lives i have one question though why is our nationalism so exclusionary when our nation is so inclusive in the nationalism that our ruling party promotes there are some communities who belong here and others who do not and even among those who belong they exploit divisions in their us vs them vision of the world some religions are foreign some values are foreign even some culinary traditions are foreign and therefore frowned upon but the india i know and love is just the opposite of that we embrace influences from all over our language our food our clothes our music our cinema have absorbed so many diverse influences that to pretend they come from a single legit source is absurd even the elegant churidar kurtas our prime minister wears have an islamic origin as an example take the recent film gully boy its style of music the clothes its protagonists wear even the attitudes in the film would have seemed alien to us a few decades ago and yet could there be a truer portrait of young india this inclusiveness this joyous khichdi that we are is what makes our nation a model for the rest of the world no nation embraces all other nations as ours does my india celebrates differences and i do as well i wear my kurta with jeans i listen to ghazals i eat dhansak and kababs and i dream in the indian language called english this is my nationalism those who try to divide us therefore are the true anti nationals we must reclaim nationalism from them by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india one of my favourite english words comes from chess if it is your turn to move but any move you make makes your position worse you are in zugzwang narendra modi was in zugzwang after the pulwama attacks a few days agoas any indian prime minister in his place would have been an indian pm after an attack for which pakistan is held responsible has only unsavoury choices in front of him he is pulled in two opposite directions one strategy dictates that he must not escalate two politics dictates that he must let us unpack that first consider the strategic imperatives ever since both india and pakistan became nuclear powers a conventional war has become next to impossible because of the threat of a nuclear war if india escalates beyond a point pakistan might bring their nuclear weapons into play even a limited nuclear war could cause millions of casualties and devastate our economy thus no matter what the provocation india needs to calibrate its response so that the pakistan does not take it all the way it is impossible to predict what actions pakistan might view as sufficient provocation so india has tended to play it safe do not capture territory do not attack military assets do not kill civilians in other words surgical strikes on alleged terrorist camps is the most we can do given that pakistan knows that it is irrational for india to react and our leaders tend to be rational they can bleed us with a thousand cuts as their doctrine states with impunity both in when our parliament was attacked and the bjp s atal bihari vajpayee was pm and in when mumbai was attacked and the congress s manmohan singh was pm our leaders considered all the options on the tablebut were forced to do nothing but is doing nothing an option in an election year leave strategy aside and turn to politics india has been attacked forty soldiers have been killed and the nation is traumatised and baying for blood it is now politically impossible to not retaliateespecially for a pm who has criticized his predecessor for being weak and portrayed himself as a inch chested man of action i have no doubt that modi is a rational man and knows the possible consequences of escalation but he also knows the possible consequences of not escalatinghe could dilute his brand and lose the elections thus he is forced to act and after he acts his pakistan counterpart will face the same domestic pressure to retaliate and will have to attack back and so on till my home in versova is swallowed up by a nuclear crater right well not exactly there is a way to resolve this paradox india and pakistan can both escalate not via military actions but via optics modi and imran khan who you would expect to feel like the loneliest men on earth right now can find sweet company in each other their incentives are aligned neither man wants this to turn into a full fledged war both men want to appear macho in front of their domestic constituencies both men are masters at building narratives and have a pliant media that will help them thus india can carry out a surgical strike and claim it destroyed a camp killed terrorists and forced pakistan to return a braveheart prisoner of war pakistan can say india merely destroyed two trees plus a rock and claim the high moral ground by returning the prisoner after giving him good masala tea a benign military equilibrium is maintained and both men come out looking like strong leaders a win win game for the pms that avoids a lose lose game for their nations they can give themselves a high five in private when they meet next and imran can whisper to modi you are a good spinner bro there is one problem here though what if the optics do not work if modi feels that his public is too sceptical and he needs to do more he might feel forced to resort to actual military escalation the fog of politics might obscure the possible consequences if the resultant indian military action causes serious damage pakistan will have to respond in kind in the chain of events that then begins with body bags piling up neither man may be able to back down they could end up as prisoners of circumstanceand so could we also check out amit varma the two pakistansepisode of the seen and the unseen india in the nuclear ageepisode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india steven pinker in his book enlightenment now relates an old russian joke about two peasants named boris and igor they are both poor boris has a goat igor does not one day igor is granted a wish by a visiting fairy what will he wish for i wish he says that boris s goat should die the joke ends there revealing as much about human nature as about economics consider the three things that happen if the fairy grants the wish one boris becomes poorer two igor stays poor three inequality reduces is any of them a good outcome i feel exasperated when i hear intellectuals and columnists talking about economic inequality it is my contention that india s problem is poverty and that poverty and inequality are two very different things that often do not coincide to illustrate this i sometimes ask this question in which of the following countries would you rather be poor usa or bangladesh the obvious answer is usa where the poor are much better off than the poor of bangladesh and yet while bangladesh has greater poverty the usa has higher inequality indeed take a look at the countries of the world measured by the gini index which is that standard metric used to measure inequality and you will find that usa hong kong singapore and the united kingdom all have greater inequality than bangladesh liberia pakistan and sierra leone which are much poorer and yet while the poor of bangladesh would love to migrate to unequal usa i do not hear of too many people wishing to go in the opposite direction indeed people vote with their feet when it comes to choosing between poverty and inequality all of human history is a story of migration from rural areas to cities which have greater inequality if poverty and inequality are so different why do people conflate the two a key reason is that we tend to think of the world in zero sum ways for someone to win someone else must lose if the rich get richer the poor must be getting poorer and the presence of poverty must be proof of inequality but that is not how the world works the pie is not fixed economic growth is a positive sum game and leads to an expansion of the pie and everybody benefits in absolute terms the rich get richer and so do the poor often enough to come out of poverty and so in any growing economy as poverty reduces inequality tends to increase this is counter intuitive i know so used are we to zero sum thinking this is exactly what has happened in india since we liberalised parts of our economy in most people who complain about inequality in india are using the wrong word and are really worried about poverty put a millionaire in a room with a billionaire and no one will complain about the inequality in that room but put a starving beggar in there and the situation is morally objectionable it is the poverty that makes it a problem not the inequality you might think that this is just semantics but words matter poverty and inequality are different phenomena with opposite solutions you can solve for inequality by making everyone equally poor or you could solve for it by redistributing from the rich to the poor as if the pie was fixed the problem with this as any economist will tell you is that there is a trade off between redistribution and growth all redistribution comes at the cost of growing the pie and only growth can solve the problem of poverty in a country like ours it has been estimated that in india for every one percent rise in gdp two million people come out of poverty that is a stunning statistic when millions of indians do not have enough money to eat properly or sleep with a roof over their heads it is our moral imperative to help them rise out of poverty the policies that will make this possible allowing free markets incentivising investment and job creation removing state oppression are likely to lead to greater inequality so what it is more urgent to make sure that every indian has enough to fulfil his basic needs what the philosopher harry frankfurt in his fine book on inequality called the doctrine of sufficiency the elite in their airconditioned drawing rooms and those who live in rich countries can follow the fashions of the west and talk compassionately about inequality india does not have that luxury by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india it is election season and promises are raining down on voters like rose petals on naive newlyweds earlier this week the congress party announced a minimum income guarantee for the poor this friday the modi government released a budget full of sops as the days go by the promises will get bolder and you might feel important that so much attention is being given to you well the joke is on you every election hl mencken once said is an advance auction sale of stolen goods a bunch of competing mafias fight to rule over you for the next five years you decide who wins on the basis of who can bribe you better with your own money this is an absurd situation which i tried to express in a couple of years ago politics a neta who loves currency notes told me what his line of work denotes it is kind of funny we steal people s money and use some of it to buy their votes we are the dupes here and we pay far more to keep this circus going than this circus costs it would be okay if the parties once they came to power provided good governance but voters have given up on that and now only want patronage and handouts that leads to one of the biggest problems in indian politics we are stuck in an equilibrium where all good politics is bad economics and vice versa for example the minimum guarantee for the poor is good politics because the optics are great it is basically garibi hatao that slogan made indira gandhi a political juggernaut in the s at the same time that she unleashed a series of economic policies that kept millions of people in garibi for decades longer than they should have been this time the congress has released no details and keeping it vague makes sense because i find it hard to see how it can make economic sense depending on how they define poor how much income they offer and what the cost is the plan will either be ineffective or unworkable the modi government s interim budget announced a handout for poor farmers that seemed rather pointless given our agricultural distress offering a poor farmer bucks a month seems almost like mockery such condescending handouts solve nothing the poor want jobs and opportunities those come with growth which requires structural reforms structural reforms do not sound sexy as election promises handouts do a classic example is farm loan waivers we have reached a stage in our politics where every party has to promise them to assuage farmers who are a strong vote bank everywhere you cannot blame farmers for wanting them they are a necessary anaesthetic but no government has yet made a serious attempt at tackling of our agricultural crisis why is it that good politics in india is always bad economics let me put forth some possible reasons one voters tend to think in zero sum ways as if the pie is fixed and the only way to bring people out of poverty is to redistribute the truth is that trade is a positive sum game and nations can only be lifted out of poverty when the whole pie grows but this is unintuitive two indian politics revolves around identity and patronage the spoils of power are limited that is indeed a zero sum game so you are likely to vote for whoever can look after the interests of your in group rather than care about the economy as a whole three voters tend to stay uninformed for good reasons because of what public choice economists call rational ignorance a single vote is unlikely to make a difference in an election so why put in the effort to understand the nuances of economics and governance just ask what is in it for me and go with whatever seems to be the best answer four politicians have a short term horizon geared towards winning the next election a good policy that may take years to play out is unattractive a policy that will win them votes in the short term is preferable sadly no indian party has shown a willingness to aim for the long term the congress has produced new gandhis but not new ideas and while the bjp did make some solid promises in they did not walk that talk and have proved to be as arun shourie once called them upa cow even the congress is adopting the cow in fact so maybe the bjp will add temple to that mix benjamin franklin once said democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch this election season my friends the people of india are on the menu you have been deveined and deboned marinated with rhetoric seasoned with narrative now enter the oven and vote by amit varma in a slightly shorter version of this was published as the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india whenever the pressures of the world get too much for me i lighten the burden by going over to donald trump s twitter feed trump the only president who would fail the turing test keeps lashing out at opponents and saying outrageous things often in all caps the internet version of screaming it is wonderfully entertaining and got even more so when he lashed out at narendra modi last week trump said i could give you an example where i get along very well with india and prime minister modi but he is constantly telling me he built a library in afghanistan library that is like five hours of what we spend and he tells me he is very smart we are supposed to say oh thank you for the library do not know who is using it in afghanistan modi fanbois also tend to be trump fanbois because they like macho men and this must have been confusing to them at multiple levels one why was trump lashing out at modi two if trump is telling the truth why does modi keep boasting about building a library three what library after much googling in the pmo our officials figured that despite having spent over us billion in afghanistan since we had not built a library maybe trump confused the parliament building with a library but it was unlikely that modi would boast to trump even about that especially constantly so trump was lying right no trump was not lying i say he was bullshitting i am not just dropping slang here bullshit may appear to be a pejorative but it has become a technical term after the philosopher harry frankfurt published his seminal book on bullshit in and if we are to understand the likes of trump it is important to understand the distinction between bullshit and lies a liar as per frankfurt acknowledges the truth and aims to deceive for a bullshitter the truth is irrelevant bullshitters aim not to deceive but are just winging it saying whatever comes into their head at a given point in time which may or may not be true for trump everything comes down to how macho he is and how others are messing around at america s expense and only he can stop them his boast about modi constantly talking to him about a library was in this vein he could also have said that modi wears ladies underwear or modi begged him to open a casino in lutyen s delhi or modi wore a suit with his name on it any relationship that bullshit has with the truth is usually coincidental trump bullshits a lot and then doubles down on his bullshit once he has released it for example the wall that mexico will pay for i am sure he was winging it when he first came up with it ironically his latest target is a master bullshitter himself when modi spoke of the first plastic surgery in india being done on lord ganesha or climate change being a consequence of people getting older he was not lying but bullshitting he is not educated or knowledgeable enough to know the truth in any of those cases so it does not matter to him and it seems not to matter to any of us either politicians can get away with bullshit and lying because people do not care about facts we tend to form echo chambers with like minded people form whatever worldview appeals to us and shut ourselves off from conflicting views behavioural scientists point to hard wiring in the brain that strengthens this process the confirmation bias ensures that we only consider facts that agree with our worldview and ignore the rest the backfire effect worryingly for fact checkers ensures that our worldviews actually grow stronger when we are presented with conflicting evidence these echo chambers once formed tend to grow more and more strident experiments by social scientists have found that when people with similar opinions are thrown together in a group they tend to take decisions more extreme than any one individual would take this is known as group polarisation you see this in social media where discourse is polarised and opposing sides are talking past each other not to each other with every individual performing to impress his own side when all discourse takes place along tribal lines rhetoric matters facts do not is bullshit a feature or a bug an entire nation will vote upon it this year as india goes to the polls narendra modi has focussed entirely on optics and not on performance betting that once people have formed a narrative inside their heads facts are irrelevant is an a in campaigning more important than a f in governance

of india the late farmer leader sharad joshi used to enjoy reciting a poem that described the indian farmer s plight perfectly it addresses the non farmer from the farmer s point of view and it goes

friend and so do you i sell my produce cheap and die you pay so much that you die too this beautiful shair expresses an old truth that many investigative journalists wrote about anew this week as protesting farmers congregated on delhi the gap between what farmers get for their produce and what the consumer pays one report revealed that a farmer sold tomatoes at rs per kg and consumers bought them for rs too little and too much both the farmers and consumers were getting killed by this just like in the poem joshi s insight in the late s was that this was caused not by the greed of middlemen but the interference of the indian state the state had set forth rules that the farmer could not sell his produce in an open market responding to supply and demand but only to a government appointed body called the agricultural produce market committee apmc because the farmers are not allowed to sell to anyone else they are forced to take the price offered to them and because all produce comes through the apmc buyers also have no bargaining power now imagine what would happen if the free market was allowed to operate middlemen would compete to buy goods from farmers and that competition would ensure that farmers would get a better price they would also compete for customers this ensuring that customers would pay less instead of farmers selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs you could have the farmer selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs both farmer and consumer would benefit by rs per kg but the government does not allow this and both farmers and consumers get hurt joshi referred to this notional cost paid by the farmer as a negative subsidy he viewed it correctly as theft the issue here is not that farmers are hard up and the government is not helping them the issue is that the government is responsible for the poverty of the farmer and is stealing from him and this is not the only way that the government is crippling our farmers farmers are not allowed access to markets in anything they do the state does not allow free markets in inputs because of which many of the inputs a farmer needs from seeds to fertilisers to energy to even credit are either hard to come by or of a low quality and when they do manage to produce crops they are not allowed to get the best price for it as an open market would enable by denying them freedom the state effectively imprisons our farmers in what a friend of mine calls ppp perpetually planned poverty this extends not just to their produce but to their property farmers are not allowed to sell their land for non agricultural purposes this restricts their market to other farmers and ensures that the price they can get for their land is so low that it becomes pointless to sell it has been estimated that some farmland would be forty times as valuable if this law did not exist indeed a common scam is for a crony of the state to acquire land from farmers through the state at low prices and then get the land use certificate changed so that they can sell at many multiples of that price all perfectly legal and deeply unethical this is how robert vadra was alleged to have made his money in fact every political party in our history has let our farmers down but there is a reason things are coming to a head now india is already facing a jobs crisis made worse by the deepening of the agricultural crisis with every generation land holdings get smaller one farmer s land is split among multiple children and more and more unsustainable it is no coincidence that many recent popular uprisings have been around demand for jobs from land owning castes like like jats patidars and marathas indian agriculture has been in crisis for decades more than of our country is in the agricultural sector producing of our gdp in developing countries less than of the population works in agriculture here we have trapped our farmers in poverty and also not allowed the industrial revolution that would have provided an escape route we pay lip service to farmers but instead of making the necessary structural reforms we give handouts like farm loan waivers that provide only temporary relief it is like handing aspirin to a burning man here we say take this for the pain and everybody claps also check out epsiode of the seen and the unseen featuring farmer leader gunvant

or go slow consent confuses me i told him well you see if she does not say yes it means no by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india this has been a year of glorious gifts from unelected middle aged men the supreme court of india is churning out enlightened judgements as if oppression is going out of fashion privacy and now adultery on thursday the court struck down section of the indian penal code this section read whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man without the consent or connivance of that man such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape is guilty of the offense of adultery and shall be punished as the part about the consent of the husband indicates the law treated women as the property of their husbands and adultery like a form of theft justice dy chandrachud wrote in his judgement the history of section reveals that the law on adultery was for the benefit of the husband for him to secure ownership over the sexuality of his wife it was aimed at preventing the woman from exercising her sexual agency as chandrachud elaborates in his judgement this has been a ubiquitous attitude towards adultery throughout history babylon s ancient hammurabi code prescribed that a married woman caught in adultery be bound to her lover and thrown into the water so that they drown together no such punishment for an unfaithful man mind you ancient greco roman societies considered adultery to be a violation of a husband s exclusive sexual access to his wife and judaic and christian laws followed a similar logic this went beyond ancient times in england introduced the death penalty for adultery with the act for suppressing the detestable sins of incest adultery and fornication section which they later thrust upon this particular colony was an adulterated version of this in the st century no law should deny the autonomy and agency of a woman but what if society itself is regressive and denies women basic human dignity as is the case in india chandrachud remarks law and society are intrinsically connected and oppressive social values often find expression in legal structures but he adds the constitution both in text and interpretation has played a significant role in the evolution of law from being an instrument of oppression to becoming one of liberation one bad law has gone but we remain a nation in which women are second class citizens firstly similar laws remain in the books such as section which deals with enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman and also treats women as the property of men secondly hell look at indian society around you some of us engish speaking elite types imagine that things must be getting better because we see so many strong articulate women around us but that is the selection bias at play outside these circles women in india are having a tough time women still fill government forms that insist on father s husbands name as if to establish ownership one telling metric female participation in the workforce has actually gone down in the last two decades much of what we call empowerment is on the terms of men so many men signal how modern they are by boasting about how they let their wife work or how they help out with domestic chores they behave as if they deserve a pat of their backs for not beating their wives and chaining them to the kitchen we have set the bar so low that not being a monster is now a matter of congratulations men tend to be oblivious of how women carry their gender as a burden something i realised recently and shame on me for being so late to realise it in my forties is that my gender is not a factor in my everyday life i can ignore and take for granted my maleness but in every single thing a woman does her gender comes into play an empty compartment at a train station the tone of voice in a job interview the supercilious sniggering men who always interrupt whose eyes travel like you know their hands would if they had the license every day women have to confront and make peace with their own thingness every day they find new reasons to question themselves the ever present human anxiety about what others think of us is amplified for women and restraint becomes a reflex i have a secondary rant here just as the adultery law saw women as the property of men many of our laws and parts of our constitution treat citizens as the property of the state we are subjects of a mai baap master which can regulate our speech and our behaviour we take this for granted just as many women take the oppression they face for granted we cannot be a free society until we address this the supreme court cannot deliver us from ourselves no matter how ugly the sight we must look within also check out amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen amit varma amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the third installment of my cricket column for cricket next and was published on september every time india loses a test series abroad the doomed relationship between the indian cricket fan and the indian cricket player comes into focus the player usually disappoints the fan and when the fan is delighted it is often for the wrong reason this is because the player and the fan look at the game in completely different ways so different in fact that we might be talking about different sports here the crux of this difference the indian cricket fan is results oriented there have been many loud judgements made by fans in the course of this series against england all expressed with great passion and conviction hardik pandya should not have played the first two tests virat kohli was right to pick hardik for the third test redemption kohli was wrong to pick hardik for the fourth and he must be dropped i have heard these three come from the same person though they are absurd together kl rahul should be not be in the side after the fifth test wait oops what these judgements and so many others through the series have in common is that they are based on results consider the different types of judgements fans tend to pass judgements around selection so and so should not be picked instead of you and yo example picking rohit sharma instead of ajinkya rahane at the start of the test series in south africa judgements around events what a horrible shot rishabh pant played to get out in the fifth test bad boy judgements around a side s approach why were rahul and pant so aggressive after tea on the fifth day in the fifth test maybe we could have gotten a draw if they had tried to play the day out judgements around well results we lost we are a horrible side i am not taking a position on these specific judgements but on the basis on which they are made at this point you would be justified in asking me wtf columnist bro if we do not make judgements based on results what do we base them on do not players look at the game the same way should not they well no all elite sportspeople think about the game probabilistically and are not results oriented they value process more than results that is the only route to success in anything and i learnt it viscerally when i shifted from being a fan to a player not a cricket player do not worry after about a decade in cricket journalism i chucked it around eight years ago and spent five years as a professional poker player poker is a game of skill but has a higher quantum of luck than other sports in fact it has been said that the key skill in poker is the management of luck this might well be true to any other sport and of life itself one of the early lessons i learnt in poker was that one cannot be results oriented i will not bore you with poker talk so let me give my favourite illustration of this i promise this is relevant to cricket and kohli and so bear with me let us say you have an evenly weighted coin that will fall heads or tails of the time each over the long run a friend offers you a deal you will flip that coin an unspecified number of times every time it hands on heads he will give you rs every time it lands on tails you give him rs it does not take rocket science to figure out why this is profitable you calculate the expected value ev of a single flip to be rs if you flip it times you get x and lose x to gain rupees divide by the more you flip the more money you make it is clearly right to accept the bet and start spinning that coin but here s the thing thinking probabilistically tells you that the decision to flip the coin is always profitable to the tune of one rupee but the actual result is always a harsh binary you either win bucks or lose let us say you flip the coin once it lands on tails and your friend takes the money and walks off does that make it a bad decision maybe he sees your downcast face and spins it again tails again now hell he could even get ten tails in a row unlikely as that seems ten tails in a row is actually inevitable at some point if you spin the coin enough and you just got unlucky here to get a sense of this do read my old piece so you end up as a big loser but does this mean your decision making was flawed the key to winning in poker is to keep making the best decision you can and not worry about the short term variance of results this is also the key to winning in life but i will not bore you any more on this for a deeper explanation involving football and parallel universes do read my old essay my point is that all actions in all sports carry probabilities with them and have an inherent ev for example when lionel messi find the ball at his feet three feet outside the box with two defenders converging to get in his way he knows the probabilities of a trying to weave his way through them to score directly b drawing them away from the goal and passing into the space his run would have created for his colleague luis suarez c suarez scoring from there d messi just going for a direct shot on goal now e messi sprinting into the box and falling hoping for a penalty these numbers would be internalised by messi s coaches and the optimal behaviour in such a spot would be second nature to messi the thing is he could make the optimal move with a chance of success and miss he could do something sub optimal with a chance and succeed as he will one twentieth of the time in that situation the first decision would not be wrong just because he did not score the second would not be right just because he did we have no way of knowing though messi is in the best position to judge and we can only tell how good a player s decision making is over an extremely long term when we have good enough sample sizes to draw reliable conclusions in cricket that long term is not possible now consider the many kinds of ev a captain like virat kohli has to calculate when he takes the field one is of the strategic value of aggression should batsmen be aggressive and show intent in test matches the merit in this you do not let bowlers get into a rhythm you could take the game away in one good session if it works the confidence can create a decisive virtuous cycle the danger you could lose too many wickets too quickly when it does not work and lose the game in a session the players who fail thus could lose confidence this could create a vicious cycle this is a tough decision every test match has uniquely different conditions and it is impossible to get a large enough sample size to come to any conclusion i would need data from tens of thousands of games with and without this approach to have confidence in a judgement in the absence of such a sample a captain like kohli has to go with his gut to form a philosophy around this he has chosen aggression and prefers free scoring batsmen like kl rahul shikhar dhawan and hardik pandya to plodders like cheteshwar pujara and ajinkya rahane he is no doubt biased by the good results of his own aggression ignoring the fact that the risk reward ratio is different for him because he is a superior player to all the guys named above from the ev of a strategy let us move to the ev of a specific decision picking hardik pandya in a test xi in england i am a fan of pandya and i think kohli s rationale for playing him would be the same as mine he is an under rated batsman whose aggression can swing a game in a session even if he averages five runs an innings lower than a specialist no batsman the ten useful overs he can provide in a day giving rest to the specialist bowlers is worth those five runs playing him instead of a specialist no in my opinion carries a positive ev now he was our matchwinner in the third test and kohli s faith in him seemed vindicated he flopped in the fourth and had to be dropped following the public outcry from fans but this is indisputable his ev in the third and fourth test was identical the results though were very different what is that ev should he play tests for us we can make our own judgements on that but those two results which drew such acclaim and derision respectively are for all practical purposes random noise at the moment the results indicate that kohli is a bad captain and made mistakes in this series but are five tests in england enough to judge in a season where this batch of the duke s ball swung more than normal tosses were decisive and england won all the tosses could the probabilities have been on his side but not luck are fans being harsh by judging kohli on the results of the series what are the possible counterfactuals i do not want to defend kohli or take a specific stance here nor am i arguing that we should suspend all judgement entirely but we should be aware that what happens on a cricket field is an inadequate way to evaluate a game because it is a tiny fraction of what the sport is about the real drama of cricket the ebb and flow that matters lies in the possibilities and probabilities of what can happen not in the boring binaries of what does watching the game would be a richer experience for us if we focussed as the players do on the journey and not the destination by amit varma in this is the second installment of my cricket column for cricket next and was published on september george bernard shaw once wrote a play called man and superman you could steal that title and use it for a film on virat kohli s life right now as a batsman he is in superhero territory he plays every match on a different easier pitch than his colleagues do and has established himself as an all time great english conditions were once held to be his kryptonyte but he is put that to rest with his sublime batting in this series leaving aside costume requirementshe still wears his underwear inside his pantshe is every bit a batting superhero kohli is also the captain of his side though and in that avatar is just a frail human india was walloped in south africa earlier this year and just lost the fourth test in england to go down both these opponents were themselves far from at their best and the decisions kohli made as captain have gotten much of the flak for these defeats especially selectorial decisions why rohit over rahane at the start of the sa series why drop cheteshwar pujara in the first test in england why persist with hardik pandya when he does not seem to bring enough value with either bat or ball i agree with some of those criticisms but not others and i feel the critics may be making a mistake by being too results orientedi will elaborate on that in my next column it is certainly true though that while kohli has transcended his human limitations when it comes to the skill of batting he has not done so when it comes to decision making as a captain like all of us he has a flawed machine inside his skull with modules that evolved as features in prehistoric times but which are bugs now there are cognitive biases and flawed heuristic that can lead us astray in our decision making and i will try to address some of them in this piece note that while i will cite examples of specific decisions i am not taking a position on any of them here maybe they were good decisions unfairly criticized maybe they were bad ones maybe we will never know i am just going to lay out some of the traps that anyone who selects a cricket team can fall intoand these apply to all of us in everything we do do they apply to kohli that is something for youand himto think about first up there is the which is defined as a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person s mind when evaluating a specific topic concept method or decision there are various ways this can play out number one when a captain speaks up in selection meetings he is likely to favour players he has actually seen up close as opposed to those who have performed as well but he has not seen so much of them this could lead kohli for example to be more likely to bat for players who qualities he knows personally from teams he has played for like rcb or it could lead to the where he opts to stick with players he is familiar with rather than take a risk on the relatively unknown this can also come from the a cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information kohli is not the sole selector of course and you could argue that they often pick fresh talent from the ipl more than from domestic cricket because the ipl is much more in the spotlight domestic first class cricket is supposed to be the feeder system for test cricket and by that logic you would imagine mayank agarwal with his prolific performances in the ranji trophy would be in the indian squad could his absence be because he had a mediocre ipl and the availability heuristic kicked in all humans give in to the our tendency to make sense of the world through stories this is actually a necessity for how else can we navigate a complex world but we must beware of getting wedded to a false narrative for example let us say that kohli decides that rohit sharma has too much talent to be left out of the test side plays with the correct intent and must be persisted with i am not expressing a view on the merit of this particular narrative just using it as an example since it is a common criticism of kohli once kohli has picked this narrative he is wired to ignore all evidence against it and consider only all evidence that supports it this is called the defined as the tendency to search for interpret favor and recall information in a way that confirms one s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses you see this all the time among political and ideological tribes on twitter in the context of our example narrative it could mean that every time rohit derisively and unfairly called nohit by his detractors does well kohli says ah i knew it all along and every time he fails kohli shrugs it off as an aberration it becomes easy to do and explain rohit is failures by citing small sample sizes which is a reasonable argument in its own right a related tendency is the which is the finding that given evidence against their beliefs people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly so if rohit makes a quick cameo and gets out that could actually strengthen kohli s belief rather than weaken it the may have something to do with it this is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them in this case kohli would own the decision to persist with rohit and it would seem better to him than it actually is here are some other biases that could apply to this narrative the a proposed psychological phenomenon that a person who has already performed a favor for another is more likely to do another favor for the other than if they had received a favor from that person the a metaphor for the reflex like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms beliefs or paradigms do consider also the and the which i hardly need to define another factor that comes into play when sticking with a bad decision is the which can also be described as escalation of commitment this is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision action or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course an everyday example of this we buy a ticket to watch a movie hate the first half but do not walk out at the interval because hey the money we spent on the ticket will be wasted the correct approach is to view the ticket money as a sunk cost and optimise our enjoyment in the time to come but no there is this fallacy this might also lead to the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period it will happen less frequently in the future an example you flip an evenly weighted coin three times and each time it lands on tails so you feel that heads is due and the next one will surely be heads the probability remains for any individual spin of the coin because coins do not have a memory similarly a batsman s chances of succeeding in the next innings are what they are past failures does not mean that a success is due kohli might also suffer from the a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual communicating with other individuals unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand is it possible for example that he unfairly expects less talented players like pujara and ajinkya rahane to bat at a similar strike rate to him because he himself knows how to bat at a healthy momentum and has the skill to do so even if he does his teammates are unlikely to dissent too much which might lead to the the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them this would ensure that he gets no negative feedback from within the team what about from outside well indian captains have a tradition of ignoring the media which a smart thing to do these days given the quality of it but could kohli also be giving in to the the tendency to interpret others behaviors as having hostile intent even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign i could go on forever but you get the drift the purpose of this piece is not to criticize kohli or even the individuals mentioned in the example such as poor rohit nohit who was finally removed from the test side when it all got too much we are all hardwired with these cognitive biases we would all improve our decision making if we were aware of them our quest as humans always is to transcend ourselves kohli has done this as a batsman and i hope he manages to do it as a captain by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india remember remember the sixth of september in many ways this date in is as momentous as august was on that day india gained freedom from a foreign ruler but indians remained unfree subjects of an oppressive indian state instead of an oppressive colonial one we were denied so many types of freedom and took that condition for granted this week though an important sliver of liberty was finally handed to us this is also independence day the repeal of section is an emotional victory but the tears are bittersweet the fact remains that it took five unelected men to set this right in this great democracy of ours where the voice of the people is supposed to find expression in its politics not one political party in the last years tried to repeal parties do not have principles only incentives and all of them behaved this way because they feared that voters would not approve that tells you what every gay person in this country already knows from lived experience our society is homophobic not just that our society and the state do not give a damn about consent the central principle of this judgement was consent no one has the right to come between two consenting adults consent is the foundation of all human rights and should be the foundation of our republic and yet despite this one historic judgement on one domain of consent we remain a land that does not care for this principle consider the arts we are a country where films made for adults by adults are routinely censored books are banned objectionable art exhibitions are shut down or vandalised artists and patrons consenting adults all are prevented from enriching each other consider free speech as in any other marketplace all of us benefit when there is competition in the marketplace of ideas and yet we have laws in the indian penal code like a and a which allow anyone to claim offence and shut free speech down like these laws are colonial artefacts but they are actually validated by the most illiberal part of our constitution article which allows caveats to free speech on grounds like public order and decency and morality those are open to interpretation and anything goes consider food the government regulates what you may or may not eat consider health you cannot take cannabis for medical use or any other medicine not approved by a government body consider education you could get arrested for home schooling your children if you find government schools inadequate and there are so many restrictions placed on private schools that come between consenting parents and consenting teachers indeed markets are as big a battleground for consent as bedrooms or kitchens if we do not interfere between consenting adults in a bedroom or kitchen what moral justification is there for doing so in the marketplace every time a voluntary exchange happens between two people it does so because both people benefit life and markets are a positive sum game and yet governments regulate and stop voluntary exchanges between consenting adults all the time often acting on behalf of entrenched interests they restrict competition harming consumers aka citizens and benefiting cronies the most poignant victims of this are our farmers our entire agricultural crisis is a result of our farmers having their autonomy snatched away from them they are the least free of indians and are trapped in a cycle of dependency but this is a subject for another column perhaps years after the british left is we have the mentality of the colonised we behave as if we are subjects of a mai baap state and not its masters the state should exist to serve us not the other way around we give the state a monopoly on violence so that it can protect our rights not so that it takes them away with the threat of violence it is not a safeguard for our liberty but the biggest threat to it we got lucky this time with the supreme court ruling but we cannot rely on the court every time there are too many freedoms to fight for and unless the parties that run this country see political capital in it they will not grant us those freedoms but i have hope the outpouring of joy at the repeal of may indicate that things are changing have we started caring about each other and about freedom a little bit more are we beginning to recognise that a nation cannot truly be free until all its citizens are free are we going to bring about more trysts with destiny by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a debate has been conducted in india since the kerala floods broke not through words but through actions two different ideas of india are being debated they are opposite ideas and we will soon be called upon to choose one of them to get a sense of the first idea consider the countless heroes who stepped up in kerala to help the countless victims as the water levels rose as homes were submerged and livelihoods destroyed fisherfolk from across the state turned their boats inwards to help the most enduring image jaisal kp a fisherman from mallapuram bending and offering his back as a ramp for rescued people getting on a boat thousands of volunteers from across the country even as far away as kashmir turned up to volunteer at relief camps those locals who escaped the worst of it stopped their onam shopping to buy relief materials instead thousands donated to the chief minister s relief fund including an eight year girl who had been saving for four years to buy a bicycle she donated every rupee in the town of suntikoppa the local church temple and madarsa turned into relief camps coordinating with each other as if to say our religion is humanity what is this idea of india it is the idea that we are one people we celebrate our differences but we recognise that what holds us together is stronger than anything that pulls us apart in this india when the water level rises no one will ask what your religion caste language state cuisine or ideology is they will offer you their hand or their boat or their bicycle the other idea of india is filled with hate and anger one man claimed this was god s punishment on kerala because menstruating women had been allowed into the sabarimala temple another claimed that it was god s punishment on kerala s muslims and christians for well not being hindu another appeal went out for donations only to go to hindu organisations which would help only hindus there were those who wanted not only to gloat on kerala s misfortune but to prevent it from getting help a gentleman who was later revealed to be a member of the bjp it cell put out a viral video saying that since kerala did not have too many poor people there was no need to donate another man in an army uniform gave a similar message only for the army to then declare that the fellow was an imposter in all this the hindutva whatsapp factories were active they circulated images supposedly of rss people distributing relief though some of them turned out to be of non rss people including from the communist parties and the others were old recycled pictures will not help will not allow others to help will take credit anyway this was also the story of the central government when the kerala government asked for aid the narendra modi government gave a pittance a fraction of what had been asked for and what they had given other states for smaller tragedies when speculation spread that the uae government had offered rs crores as relief the modi government said it would not allow the money to go from willing donor to needy recipient yes really this is the second idea of india here we are divided by religion caste region language we feel schadenfreude not sympathy at the pain of others here it is a zero sum game and we like to see others fall as only their falling will help us rise i call this the tukde tukde vision of india people who think in terms of divisions who foment hate among their own peoplewhat else can one call them but anti national they are betraying both the inclusive entities they claim to speak for hinduism and india i consider them a greater threat to our nation than any terrorism from across the border it is true that all indian politics is identity politics every government we have ever had every party that exists today has let this nation down but this ruling party and the entire hindutva movement has hit new lows with the way they actively tried to prevent aid from reaching kerala such malice why the people they let down were not just the people of kerala but the citizens of india from across the country the rest of us were watching and deciding which of these two ideas of india is dear to us and just as this debate unfolded through actions we can make our choice clear through action vote wisely next year by amit varma in this is the first installment of politics without romance my monthly column with bloomberg quint as the name indicates this column will look at indian politics through the lens of public choice theory one more independence day comes up and it is time to ask that annual question again where have all the leaders gone it is a common lament that the politicians of today are the opposite of the freedom fighters who got us this independence we had giants then we have pygmies now our leaders then were driven by principle our leaders now are driven by the lust for power why if you look at politics through the lens of economics which i will do in this column over the new few months the answer lies in incentives why do people get into politics what do they want from it what can they realistically expect what do they need to do to get to the top what trade offs do they need to make what do they need to do to stay on top right from the th century our freedom fighters had little personal upside to their battles we were ruled by the british empire and these men had no chance of coming to power and enjoying its rewards the downside was significant though if you were in a position of influence you could lose it if you were not and fought too vigorously you could land up in jail or worse the generations of men and women who rose up to fight against the british empire did so because they were animated by a higher cause there was no personal upside to it there was a principle at stake for example freedom is my birthright and i shall have it and they cared about that principle so much that some of them were willing to die for it once independence was achieved the incentives changed firstly getting the british to leave was so miraculous coming after a decades long struggle that our leaders did not notice what we did not achieve yes we got political independence but we still were not guaranteed the personal and economic freedoms that we had fought for one of the seminal moments of our independence struggle was mahatma gandhi s protest against the tyranny of the salt tax well consider that the tax on salt is far higher today not to mention other taxes or other tyrannies here s what we did on august we replaced one set of rulers with another only the colour of their skin changed and those who had fought against those in power were now in power themselves their incentives changed would they change in the early years of our independence our politics was ruled by those who had come into the freedom struggle for the sake of principles not power i am willing to give them the benefit of doubt their mistakes were honest mistakes such as the embrace of the fabian socialism that kept india poor for decades longer than it should have that flawed thinking was the fashion of the times and was not driven by bad incentives the drive towards big government did however change incentives further henceforth it was natural that those who would be drawn to politics would be driven by the lust for power now that it was possible for indians to join the ruling class people were bound to want to do so now that we had achieved independence there no longer seemed a burning need to fight for higher principles principles would become a rationalisation a way to position a political brand to differentiate it from others those who did enter politics for reasons of principle would soon find themselves having to compromise on those principles for pragmatic reasons so much so that by the time they actually achieved power there could be no trace of those original principles there is an old truism that power corrupts it is equally true that the quest for power corrodes character there may be politicians who start off idealisticbut they cannot remain that way no matter what their public positioning why is this incentives achieving power requires two things money and votes as you can only get votes by spending money this is arguably one thing but i will speak of them as two to illustrate the different directions that politicians are pulled in first money over the decades it has gotten more and more prohibitive to fight an election one needs crores to contest even a local election where does this money come from who can afford such large sums the money always comes from interest groups who expect a return on investment there is always a quid pro quo involved i give you money but when you come to power you do xyz for me first money leads to power then power must lead to money this is the chakravyuh of politics for example if a big industrialist gives a political party money what could he want out of it one he may want regulation that protects his industry or company from competition place tariffs on foreign goods deny a license to a competitor and so on all these can be done citing seemingly noble principles two he may want special privileges that the government using its monopoly on violence can get him for example if he wants land for a factory the government can use eminent domain to get it cheaply from villagers and hand it to him three he may want soft loans from a public sector bank which he otherwise may not get from a private sector bank that has different incentives and does due diligence contemporary examples of this abound consider the interest groups that benefit from any government policy and you can follow the trail you may oppose fdi in retail for example because small traders form a large chunk of your donor base as is the case with aap and the bjp until recently you may allocate natural resources to favoured cronies as the upa was alleged to have done with coal and spectrum all of these you will note amount to a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich from us citizens to moneybag interest groups this is how power provides roi to money needless to say you do not make money only for those who fund you but also for yourself this might even be the prime personal incentive for wannabe politicians our system of big government is especially lucrative wherever there is power there is discretion and there will be corruption and our government is designed to give enormous amounts of power to those in charge which makes immense corruption inevitable this is not a function of the party in power but of the incentives in play and now to votes in our democracy elections are the process by which we decide which of the competing mafias will get to rule us for five years there is just one way for these mafias to win our votes by bribing us the party in power may hand out immediate sops the parties in opposition will promise them in the political marketplace just as in any other marketplace every brand does not try to woo every customer unlike in a regular marketplace of course there is usually only one winner parties will have vote banks that they will nurture over time and reward when they are in power the immense power of the state makes patronage politics lucrative for example you can promise reservations in government jobs to a group of your choice or even without explicit promises you can make sure the state favours the groups you are wooing either by giving them jobs or contracts or looking after them in other ways this is analogous to how a mafia rewards and protects those who give them hafta except here it is legal or you can just bribe them directly with free biryani or pressure cookers this can become a vicious circle for example everyone wants farmers votes and once one party promises farm loan waivers every other party has to follow suit loan waivers are a temporary anaesthetic that perpetuate the problem but politicians do not have the incentives to make the deep structural changes that are required in agriculture those will take years to play out much beyond an election cycle and parties need votes now the great tragedy of indian politics is that all our politics is identity politics that centres around state patronage all parties are guilty of this smaller regional parties nurture their own caste vote banks the congress pandered to minorities for decades the bjp caters to the worst bigots among us and there are enough of them now to make the party a force they also manipulated the caste politics of up masterfully in and as for aap they have pandered to khalistanis and kanwariyas alike and a prominent supporter of theirs was made to apologize to a jain muni for the reason that jains were a powerful vote bank for aap all this is inevitable what can a party do without votes what can a party do without money the imperatives of our democracy make politics morally corrosive to get to power you must privilege the means over the ends and even if your ends were noble to begin with by the time you are done your only goal is power you become the monster you might have tried to fight what could change this well if the state had less power it would offer less roi to investors there would be less money and less patronage for parties to bribe voters with imagine a limited government that existed just to protect our rights and nothing else the incentives would change it would have so little power that those who lust for power would be forced to look elsewhere for career options maybe they would join the mafia interest groups would stop funding politicians because politicians would not have power to do something in return for them voters could not be induced with short term sops or goodies can that change in the design of our government ever take place who will have the incentives to make that change not the moneybags and the interest groups that is for sure but what about the voters if enough citizens demanded reform the government would have to listen supply has to obey demand andrew brietbart once said politics is downstream of culture this is exactly right before we change our politics we must change our culture this is as noble a battle to fight as the one our great freedom fighters fought against the british empire decades ago will new leaders emerge to fight it by amit varma in this is the first installment on a cricket column i have started for cricket next in which i will write about cricket from the lens of other disciplines such as economics psychology game theory etc during his second innings in the lord s test virat kohli could be seen grimacing and a nation grimaced with him kohli has a chronic back problem the rest of the country has a chronic cricket problem why cannot our batsmen play the swinging ball in test matches in england why did this particular lot look so incapable why are they worse at this than previous generations can an asteroid please give us deliverance by hitting earth wiping humanity out and ending this pain i am both a cricket tragic and an india tragic and i will make three tragic arguments in this piece one indian batsmen of the future will be even worse against the swinging ball in england two it does not matter because test cricket is dying and there will not be any test matches in england years from now three that also does not matter because cricket will flourish nevertheless and other forms of the game have as much drama and nuance as test cricket does if in different ways this may sound dismal to you so its apt that i make my argument through the lens of the allegedly dismal science of economics in particular i want to look at incentives what are the incentives of those who view the game play the game and run the game how is their behaviour moulded by these incentives what are the implications of this first up consider the concept of opportunity cost which put simply refers to what alternative uses you could have made of the time or money you spent on something the opportunity cost of watching a test match for example is what else you could have done with the five days you spent watching it this boils down to the options available for your time for most of cricket s existence there have not been that many alternatives there is a cliche about cricket and bollywood being the two great th century passions of india but think about it what else did you have for entertainment not much television and no internet facebook whatsapp youtube netflix or easily available porn that has changed today we are inundated with options of what to do with our time that means that the opportunity cost of watching a test match has shot up and our incentive for doing so has declined most cricket purists i know do not actually spend much time watching test cricket look up another concept from economics revealed preferences the tv ratings of test cricket have been plummeting and if not for the subsidy from other forms of the game there would already be no commercial reason for the game to exist what is remarkable about test cricket is that it exists at all most other popular sports can be viewed in easy to digest nuggets football lasts minutes not nine hours tennis matches hockey games badminton encounters can all be done with within an evening and because there is no longer form of the game to compare these sports to no one complains about how they lack drama or depth i believe that we complain about twenty cricket because test matches came first so we put that on a pedestal and consider that the basis of comparison another economic concept to look up the anchoring effect had t s come first we might have viewed test cricket through a different prism of values and found it wanting use the tools of economics on a t game each team is given as many resources players as in a test or a one day match but far less overs only to play an innings in this relative scarcity of overs changes the value of all the resources a dot ball becomes more expensive for the batting side as every ball carries more value a wicket has less value than in an odi as your batting resources need to be spread out over only overs rather than the risk reward ratio changes and the value of aggression goes up this changes the incentives for batting sides aggression is rewarded the value of building an innings goes down and to finish an innings with batsmen still waiting in the pavilion counts as a waste of resources opportunity cost again batsmen thus have to innovate far more and find new ways of playing the game consider the much touted degree game of ab de villiers there invention came out of necessity the new format making demands on batsmen to expand their repertoire abd is just the most spectacular player around many other batsmen started practising new strokes playing them reflexively expanding not just their repertoire but also the orthodoxy who is to say that the reverse sweep and the ramp shot do not now belong in batting textbooks contrary to a popular canard bowlers did not turn into bowling machines their response to more aggressive batsmen was more deception and not just by bowling more slower balls and wide yorkers spinners actually began flighting the ball more inviting batsmen to hit them like back in the romanticized days of yore think back on the bowling of the spinners like rashid khan kuldeep yadav and yuzvendra chahal in the last ipl the flight the loop the aggressive intent bowlers figured out that one way to counter the momentum of a batting side was to take wickets attack became the best defence this might seem contradictory on one hand the value of a wicket goes down for a batsmen because runs are more important on the other hand the value of a wicket goes up for a bowler because it can slow a batting side s momentum so how much do wickets matter questions like this make it a fascinating time to be a cricket lover there is an ongoing conversation between batsmen and bowlers with both innovating new skills as they test this hypothesis or that this is why watching the ipl is so eye opening and mind boggling a game is evolving in front of our eyes its grammar and structure its mores and norms through a conversation between batsmen and bowlers and captains that we get to see in real time if you love cricket how can you not be enthralled now consider how the incentives change for everyone concerned viewers prefer t s to tests because the opportunity cost of watching a t game is far less besides it is an incredibly rich experience having that added dramatic element of urgency that tests do not have because of this there is more money to be made excelling in this shorter form of the game so players are incentivised to optimise for it every minute that a batsman spends expanding his repertoire of aggressive strokes though carries the opportunity cost of not practising for test match skills such as how to leave a swinging ball the inevitable outcome of this is that batsmen will always train to play t s and will be unequipped for those specialised skills that test matches demand especially test matches in england india tours england once every few years why should kl rahul who i consider a batting genius spend much time preparing for conditions he will encounter so infrequently another indication of how these incentives play out only cheteshwar pujara bothered to go to england early and prepare for this tour he did so only because he has been discarded in the other forms of the game incentives contrast this with the fact that the indian batsmen of the generation immediately preceding the ipl era the dravid tendulkar ganguly generation all played county cricket but why should kl rahul or rishabh pant bother with that it is not fair to make a value judgement about this all these players have made rational choices responding to incentives who is to say that one specific balance between bat and ball is better than some other balance who is to say that test cricket is superior to one day cricket even many who do state that as a personal preference do not actually put their eyeballs where their mouths are people who love test cricket as i do can take succour in the fact that the cricket boards will keep the form alive even when it is no longer commercially viable by subsidising it from income that comes from shorter formats but for how long will this posturing be necessary when the year old of today is years old who will care for test cricket especially if that kid is an indian viewer who watched this lord s test and thought to himself ya whatever why even bother by amit varma in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india there was outrage on twitter this week when it was revealed that the union government had since on government advertising the outrage is justifiedbut it is not enough it is not just this amount or this use of government money that we should question but the whole concept of government spending and indeed government action we in india seem to think of government as the solution to all our problems i often argue that india s biggest religion is not hinduism but the religion of government we behave as if the state is a benevolent entity with unlimited resources of its own with which it should fulfil all our wishes ban what we do not like build what we want built spend on what we think are good causes statues loan waivers awards for sportspeople ministries for cow protection and so on in all this we ignore one essential truth every act of government is an act of violence think about what the state needs in order to exist our taxes money taken from us by force no one pays taxes willingly without the threat of imprisonmentbasically abduction by the one entity that has a monopoly on violencethere would be no taxpayers there are two words that mean the act of taking someone s property without their consent no wonder people say that taxation is theft indeed it is more than that assume that you pay of your income in taxes that amounts to one fourth of your time and labour it means that for all practical purposes from january to march every year you are a slave to the state taxation is not just theft it is part time slavery contrary to a common canard everybody pays taxes taxes are not just income tax your domestic help is parted from her money when she buys a bar of soap the beggar at the traffic signal near you loses money to the government every time he buys salt even inflationusually caused by the government printing moneyis basically a tax on the poor i am not arguing that we should pay no taxes and live in anarchy the state is a necessary evil we need it to protect our rights and there is no way around the paradox that by allowing it to exist we give away some of our rights the state has to tax us to protect us and the violence it thus commits is necessary to protect us from greater violence regardless of what your ideology may be none of what i have said above is contestable it is plain fact that no one pays taxes willingly and that the threat of coercion is involved it is plain fact thus that every government action involves violence and coercion most people would also accept that some amount of this violence is necessary for we need the state to protect our rights the larger question then is what actions of the state are justified given the violence involved at every step this is where ideology begins person one a libertarian like me could argue for a minimal state that only protects our rights and nothing else if you feel the state should do other things give me the moral justification for your preferences being funded by money coercively taken from others person two may advocate a state looking after its less fortunate members proving free healthcare and education person three may care about national glory and want to build grand statues person four could argue that building infrastructure is necessary and has positive externalities it is beside the point of course that political parties are driven by imperatives beyond ideology they need money and votes to exist and win and when in power use the state as a tool to reward those who gave them money and votesalways at the expense of us citizens the purpose of this column is not to argue for or against any of those ideologies i just ask that every time you advocate government action of any kind remember that the action comes at a cost that cost is not just a financial cost but a moral one that cost involves violence committed on all of usnot just rich industrialists but also the poorest of the poor can you justify that violence by amit varma in this is the th installment of rhyme and reason my weekly set of limericks for the

in of my weekly podcast she told me that studying at sophia college enabled her to perform in front of others with confidence had there been boys in her class she said she would not have been able to claim the space of the class jester this came as a revelation to me though it should not have no male comedian would have experienced this but every woman knows what it is like aditi s point was that even though she was so privilegedborn to english speaking liberal parentsshe began her career facing obstacles her male peers never considered at least she made it through there are million people who did not one reason for india being such a poor country is that we treat half of our greatest resourceour peopleas inferior to the other half this has a huge cost which people have recently begun to quantify here are some numbers only of indian women are in the workforce next only to saudi arabia among g countries in the latest issue of the economist reveals that if female labour participation was as much as of that of men there would be an additional million women in the workforce even many of those who do work now would be more skilled and productive if treated equally with their brothers in childhood according to a mckinsey study our gdp could go up by by if female participation in the workforce matched that of men for more read in indiaspend india s misogyny carries much more than just an economic cost it is a humanitarian tragedy no other term suffices when more than half a billion people are treated as subhuman and prevented from reaching their full potential a recent study named india as the most dangerous country in the world for women which is no surprise given that women are essentially treated as the property of men these cultural attitudes are that take this approach even though we live in the st century our attitudes towards women belong in the th we must fix this let me declare it upfront i am a feminist and because that particular f word has so many shades of meaning let me define what i mean by it feminism is the belief that women deserve the same respect as individuals that men do the same moral consideration the same legal rights my feminism arises out of my belief in the primacy of individual rights with consent as an absolute value indeed i tell my fellow libertarians that to be libertarian is by default to be feminist a male friend of mine even says if you are not feminist you are not a good human being why does feminism get a bad rap then this is because just as there are all kinds of human beings there are all kinds of feminists not all stop at the principle of equal rights and offshoots of feminism can often contradict each other google gender feminism vs equity feminism many feminists feed into an identity politics in vogue today which can be as toxic as the ills it purports to be fighting also the tactics that some feminists employ can make some uncomfortable such as the recent list of alleged sexual offenders in academia who were to be deemed guilty until proven innocent but even that list had an important function which is the same one that the metoo movement highlights women are angry and will not put up with this shit any more men seem to be oblivious to the extent and ubiquity of this anger as well as to the fact that it is justified indeed one central cultural disconnect of our times can be summed up like this women are angry men are clueless this is made worse by the fact that many men who declare themselves to be feminists are just being performative basically virtue signalling to get laid as men are hardwired to do i find this irritating but i will not turn away from declaring my feminism either because of this or because of my discomfort with the tactics of some feminists the reason for this is twofold one women being treated as second class citizens hurts us all and diminishes us as human beings two it is a sad truth that because of the power dynamics around us men can actually make more of a difference than women can especially when outspoken women are being constantly minimised and mocked therefore it is imperative for us men to also fight this good fight not because of what our ancestors did or how our fellow men behave but because it is the right thing to do also check out episode of the seen and the unseen episode of the seen and the unseen by amit varma in this is the

bhakts to stop trolling me by amit varma in this is the seventh installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india all around me the air is filled with the anguished groans of cricket purists england scored against australia a few days ago in a one day match at trent bridge despite a slowdown in which no boundaries were hit in the last four overs in their previous odi at the venue against pakistan they had made and it is not just this venue everywhere it would seem mishits are going for six record scores are being posted and bowlers are settling down in bathtubs to slash their wrists the purist lament is simple for a variety of reasons the balance between bat and ball has been upset heavier bats shorter boundaries bad regulations the malign influence of twenty cricket in the good old days my friends declaim in sophisticated accents cricket was not a spectacle but a contest also though they do not say this petrol was two rupees a litre as these notional nostalgics collapse at my feet i want not to console them but to whack them on their unhelmeted heads yes cricket has changed i want to tell them but it has changed for the better get over yourself go watch a game first up let us consider why the balance of the game has shifted towards run scoring heavier bats are just part of the reason the main cause is that batsmen have been forced to develop new skills because of the changed imperatives of t cricket having ten wickets in hand but only balls in an innings means that the value of a run goes up the value of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball is immense this mandates greater aggression batsmen have thus developed a wider array of skills than previous generations needed to consider ab devillier s degree game fielders are now better than ever in the past because each run saved is that much more important and bowlers have also adapted that old cliche of t cricket being a slugfest where you can replace bowlers with bowling machines is nonsense bowlers who once focussed on restricting runs have realised that the best way to keep the score down is to take wickets attack is the best defence modern spinners like rashid chahal kuldeep are not scared to flight the ball in search of wickets in contrast to the flat odi spin bowling of the past the top teams in this latest ipl were the ones who bowled to take wickets not to restrict consider how ms dhoni used his csk fast bowlers these skills have migrated to the other forms of the gameand have enriched them the writer gideon haigh once mentioned why he found the odi world cup fascinating you got test match quality bowlingbecause the only way to slow down batsmen these days is to get them outand t batting skills that illustrates how the game has evolved into a deeper more complex beastwhich is a good thing and yes in all this the balance between bat and ball has shifted but why was the older balancesay from the s when was a good score in a over odibetter in any way is it because that is the one we are used to and which forms our comfort zone and anchors our expectations here s a thought experiment if t cricket had been invented before test cricket and tests came later how would people have responded would we wonder what the point of five day cricket was without the challenging constraint of having a limited number of balls to score your runs in another thought experiment if someone introduced a five day baseball game or a nine hour football game how would people react to them would they immediately diss the shorter form beyond the skills argument there is also a pragmatic reason to celebrate t cricket few people even performative purists have five days to watch a game of cricket these days or even one whole day there are just too many other claimants for your time cricket was heading for commercial death when this new form came to the rescue long enough to pack in immense drama short enough to finish in an evening in future t s will end up subsidising test cricket and keeping it alive indeed i celebrate t cricket not because i like it more than test cricket they are different sports requiring different skills and i find it graceless when fans of one sport disparage another i celebrate it because t s have enhanced tests by bringing new skills and strategic learnings into the game and they will keep tests alive in commercial terms that is why every purist should celebrate twenty cricket by amit varma in this is the rd installment of rhyme and reason my weekly set of limericks for the sunday times of india edit page modiji s

installment of lighthouse my monthly column for blink a supplement of the hindu business line do not make your happiness dependent on other people and all will be well when i look back on my younger self the year old amit from years ago i feel alarmed there is just nothing he is doing right his outlook to life his ambitions his work ethic his food ethic his attitude towards other people they are all wrong he is obnoxious arrogant and delusional and it seems certain to me that this cannot end well i cannot reach out across time and warn that kid and he would not listen to me this is a common lament of middle aged people like me oh if we only knew then what we know now still i am lucky to get here and no longer be that guy i know similarly aged people who have not lost their youthful delusions and wake up every morning unhappy i feel bad for them but not too bad for reasons that will be obvious by the time you finish reading this this is the th edition of lighthouse and my last column in this space so in the spirit of a happy ending i want to bow out with a list of learnings here are a few things i learned along the way from being that guy to this guy one you are not special you are one of over seven billion people on this planet which is one of billion planets in the milky way which is one of billion galaxies in the known universe so forget what the self help books tell you you are not unique or different in any way you are one accounting error of genetic composition away from a gorilla and everything you are is a result of luck the genes you happened to have and the environment you were born and raised in this is not a bad thing in fact it should be a relief two you are not entitled to anything i am shocked sometimes to see how entitled some young millennials feel till i remember that in my time we felt as entitled this is a quality of youth and the natural consequence of thinking you are special which we are hardwired to do for how else would we live but the world owes you nothing and the more entitled you feel the more you will be disappointed if you feel entitled to nothing on the other hand everything good that comes your way will feel like a delightful bonus three stop looking for validation our lives can be dominated by the need for the approval or admiration of others this is foolish for one simple reason others do not give a shit and are caught up in their own corresponding anxiety they are not thinking of you all the time you are only the center of your own universe so stop caring about what others think of you it does not matter unless you take it seriously in which case you are doomed to unhappiness as you will be sweating over what you cannot control four focus only on what you can control one sure route to be unhappy is to make your happiness dependent on things you cannot control you will then feel helpless and exhausted as you are buffeted by the winds of chance instead you should only feel good or bad about events in your immediate control the rest is what it is if you take the route that there is no free will you could even achieve a buddhist sort of complete equanimity or you could just panic leave that aside for now five focus on process not outcome this follows on from the last lesson you cannot control the outcome but you can control the process the happiest writers are those who take joy in the writing not in the awards or the money if you are stressed about outcomes you will spend your whole life stressed because outcomes are never satisfactory and when we do get what we want we immediately revise our expectations if you just take joy in the simple act of work and leave aside the results much of the stress in your life will just vanish six focus on the positives i know people consumed by negativity who wake up every morning angry and bitter that the world has not given them their due they are the sole cause of their unhappiness the world is full of things that can make you either happy or unhappy focus on the positives this creates a virtuous feedback loop you feel better and work better when you do this and that creates even more joy for yourself cut everything that is toxic and negative out of your life including people who are always cribbing life is too short to spend it sunk in despair some might argue that it is because life is short that we spend it sunk in despair but you cannot control that seven happiness lies in small things what makes you happy if you make it dependent on the fulfillment of big dreams or the actions of others you will be chasing an elusive goal the biggest lesson i have learnt is that happiness lies in small things the rich taste of strong coffee on a rainy day a few moments of laughter with friends or loved ones getting lost in a book or transported by a song or giving in to the magic of a film look around you and i am sure you will find many things that make you feel blessed what else do you need why by amit varma in deserves to

with a sleeper hit open magazines latest issue has a feature story titled and my friend sancho is one of the subjects of the piece there was actually a decent amount of buzz about the book both before and after it was published so maybe it is not so much of a sleeper but it is true as the author of that story says that cocktail crowds do not trip over each other trying to grab a photo op with me it is entirely their loss i must say for my company is more intoxicating than a long island iced tea spiked with bhang in other personal news the december issue of the indian edition of the magazine t has compiled the t tech their list of movers and shakers in the technology world anil ambani comes in at no jimmy wales is no and amit varma is no this indian list does not seem to be online but if i

at no ahead of steve jobs steve ballmer barack obama bill gates tim berners lee mike arrington and jeff bezos go figure the last time i made such an august list was in april this year when business

biggest selling indian novel released in i have seen unofficial sales figures for this year s releases from all the major publishing houses and mfs is ahead by a long way i will share mfss sales figures for the year as draws to a close it is already been on all the bestseller lists india today for and landmark for those same months just books for a few weeks in that period and all the crossword outlets that i checked each outlet has its own bestseller list even better just sent me of a pirated copy of mfs on a delhi pavement i am not sure how my publishers feel about that but i am naturally delighted much of this is word of mouth success so all of you who liked the book and told your friends thanks for that posted by amit varma on august in in the course of an email discussion points me to by bud caddell on the subject of success and happiness in the last couple of years i have moved from learn to say no journalism to learn to monetize writing novels which is problematic because you cannot really learn to monetize in this field being a novelist is not like any other profession and even publishers will tell you that they do not really know what makes a book tick you could write kickass books year after year and not have anyone notice or you could be in the right time at the right place and be an overnight success unlike other professions there is no road map to success i made the choice that i did knowing the tradeoffs involvedi would not make anywhere near the kind of moolah i would make if i stayed in journalism or went back to television but i would wake up every morning looking forward to getting down to work i think that is worth ituntil my savings run out and i cannot meet the rent thankfully mfs has sold well enough to ensure that will not happen anytime soon copies so far my publisher tells me which makes it a huge bestseller by indian standardsthe benchmark for being a bestseller in india is copies my earnings from this do not cover opportunity cost of course but they keep me afloat while i write the next one and that gives me more joy than all the journalism i ever did while on success udhay also points me to on the subject here s an excerpt that sums up my feelings on the subject quite exactly there are far too many smart educated talented people operating at quarter speed unsure of their place in the world contributing far too little to the productive engine of modern civilization there are far too many people who look like they have their act together but have yet to make an impact you know who you are it comes down to a simple gut check you either love what you do or you do not period so do you love what you do posted by amit varma on june in while i was on my mfs book tour the same questions about the book and me kept cropping up in all the cities i went to from journos and from the audiences at the launches i thought it would make sense for iu and mfs readers if i collected some of them and answered them here as well these frequently asked questions are collected on this page which will be expanded as more questions come in you can also check out my bio page and this interview meanwhile here on the iu blog as well here s the first set of questions on indian writing in english and where mfs fits in there is an unfortunate gap in india between popular fiction and literary fiction readers of literary fiction look down on popular fiction and think of it as infra dig and readers of popular fiction are intimidated by literary fiction by any indication of heft or gravitas or self indulgence an amitav ghosh reader will not read chetan bhagat and vice versa i would like my work to appeal to both kinds of readers plenty of japanese writers manage to bridge this gap in their country and writers like banana yoshimoto haruki murakami and yoko ogawa are both critically acclaimed as well as wildly popular there are not any writers like that in india writing in english creating compelling narratives that are both entertaining and thought provoking i hope to fill that space with my novels whether or not mfs lives up to that is for readers to judge on whether i am a blogger or a novelist i have wanted to be a novelist all my lifesince i began to read i wanted to tell stories and i cannot remember ever wanting to be anything else i did various other things along the way procrastinating furiously in i took some time off and tried writing a book but after words realised that it was not working and that i was not ready for it yet either in terms of craft or maturity i bided my time till i was ready and then eventually did get down to it my friend sancho is my first baby step in my career as a novelist i do not see myself doing anything else ever some readers of iu see me as a blogger turned novelist as if i became successful as a blogger found that i had a readership and then decided to write a book this could not be further from the truth i have wanted nothing else in my life but to write novels and blogging was just something that happened along the way two of the four publishers who wanted mfs did not even know i blogged the blog was irrelevant in that scheme of things and my book found its way into the world on its own merit i hope that is also how readers evaluate it on how blogging made me a better writer i think of the facility to write as akin to a muscle just as working out daily in the gym increases one s fitness regular writing makes one a better writer blogging amounted to exercising my writing muscle every day i used to be a frequent blogger and for much of my time as a blogger have averaged about five posts a day i once put up posts in a day yes i needed to get a life that is a lot of working out blogging also taught me one of the most important lessons of writing respect your reader s time when someone is online reading your blog there are a thousand other things they can do with their time the whole world is just a click away if you are self indulgent if you waffle if you use words where five will do boom they are gone to build a readership you have to keep giving your readers value for their time blogging made my writing crisper more economical and less self conscious i would like to think that these values reflect in the other writing i do on why i gave up journalism i felt that writing a novel needed me to devote myself to the fictional world i was creating and weekly deadlines for columns and suchlike got in the way i had to make a choice and so i chose to give up journalism the process of writing mfs confirmed to me that writing fiction was my natural domain and i do not intend to return to journalism now also writing columns and op eds require a different mindset from tackling literature in opinion pieces one is expected to pass judgments on things to paint the world in black and white literature gives us more scope to acknowledge the real world s complexities and to explore its ambiguities i rather prefer the latteryou will not find me passing judgement on any of my characters in mfs or in future books no matter who the character is there but for the grace of the fsm go we on why my blogging and journalistic concerns are not reflected in my novel i blog a lot about economics and politics and my columns were also on those subjects but you will not find me talking about these subjects in mfs indeed reading mfs will tell you nothing about my ideology or my political leanings which is as it should be literature is about human beings and to use a much abused phrase with a pomposity alert the human condition a book that pushes an ideology is in my view not literature but propaganda you will not find any of that coming from me on whether mfs is autobiographical my friend sancho is not autobiographical and abir ganguly is not me i have never worked in a newsroom or as a crime reporter and none of the events in the book have happened to me as a person abir is quite different from me though his sense of humour is a bit like mine writers are often wisely told write about what you know i have lived in mumbai since and love this city and know it well so obviously i set the novel here and i know a fair bit about journalism as well so that was also a natural choice for abir that said abir has no more in common with me than with any mumbai journalist it could be argued though that the character of the lizard is based on me to begin with we are both unnoticed observers of the world with an unusual perspective and then there is the reptilian looks also ok i will stop here on the voice of the book the book is a first person narrative from the point of view of abir ganguly this immature year old smart alecky reporter given to glib wisecracks the voice of the book thus is his voice as the story proceeds and he is taken out of his comfort zone by his attraction to a girl he would not have noticed in normal circumstances he changes in subtle ways and begins to see the world slightly differently this change in abir is at the heart of this bookit is a coming of age story every book has its own voice depending on what it is about and pov my second novel is a third person narrative starring an ias officer in his late s living in a city in central india and will read quite differently more q a will follow on the faq page if you have any questions of your own send em in i cannot promise to answer all the questions i get but will do so for any that have not already been addressed and that seem to be of interest to many of my readers posted by amit varma on may in i have returned to mumbai from of my life and i am tired tired tired it was fun and i enjoyed meeting so many iu readers who have now become mfs fans but the launches and interviews and early morning flights took their toll as did the effort of dodging the many panties thrown at me by adoring readers i shall thus resume regular blogging tomorrow until then be good read

delhi we have not yet finalized the details of the other events so watch this space posted by amit varma on april in i am delighted to announce the result of for my first novel my friend sancho we received so many fabulous designs that it took us a while just to look at them all carefully process them and make a shortlist after considering all the parameters hachette india my publishers were awed by the range of designs we had to choose fromand i am deeply grateful that so many people chose to take part after much debate we have a winner prem kishore of hungry foolish creative products walks away with rs worth of hachette india books here is his design click on the image below for a larger image there will be minor tweaks of course and the text and photograph at the back are dummy just for the purposes of designing but here it is of all the other designers i would also like to mention manish sahu a designer from nagpur who also manish entered designs like virender sehwag hits boundaries and more than half the shortlisted designs were by this one dude my publishers and i felt awful that after all that work he did not win so we will send him a special hachette hamperand i am certain he is going to design many covers for many lucky writers a couple of his designs and other special mentions below the fold posted by amit varma on february in are not yet ready and will be announced later many outstanding entries poured in the contest and to announce the results earlier this week we simply have not managed to pick one of them yet the delay is not hachette s but minei have not been able to make up my mind on this and i apologize to all the contestants for keeping them waiting this is my first novel and its cover is a big big deal for me and i want to be absolutely sure before we pick one so we are still tweaking the entries in small ways printing them out seeing them from a distance holding them up closeall of that stuff to all the contestantsthank you for entering and thank you for your patience also hachette would like to send each of the entrants a token of appreciation but has not been able to get in touch with all of themmails bouncing back etc if you sent in a design please write to submissions hachetteindia com with your postal address thank you as to when the results will be announced well the book s out in april and the cover has to be finalized by early february so that is the absolute latest we will take to decidethough we will try our best not to leave it so late posted by amit varma on january in choosing what to wear is not such an easy matter though to design the cover for my first novel my friend sancho is now over to all those who entered from me and hachette india thank you we have been overwhelmed by the designsnot just the number of entries that came in but the quality as my editor at hachette remarked never has any book had so many great covers to choose from we are trying to make a shortlist right now and expect to announce a winner on monday january that said announcing a winner will be heartbreaking because so many of the covers are so good in different ways many factors go into choosing a cover the subjective tastes of the people involved inputs from production on how something that looks good on the screen will look as a book the scope for effects such as in my publisher s words embossing holographic stuff texture foiling uv etc inputs from sales on what will actually work in the marketplace there are trade offs involved one cover may look beautiful and have just the right feel but may have nothing to do with the book conceptually another may be bang on in terms of suiting the book and may not be the kind of cover that stands out from a distance in a book shop it is all very complicated for this reason hachette has decided that while it can choose just one cover and award just one prize every single entrant will get a token of appreciation if you entered a design expect to hear from hachette soon meanwhile i am off to my cover designs folder to get bewildered and overwhelmed thanks again posted by amit varma on january in a reminder to my readers for my first novel my friend sancho is on until january that leaves five days for you to enter so do send in your designs if you would like to participateand tell your designer friends about it in case they are interested some excellent designs have already come in and i will showcase a whole bunch of covers that i liked on this blog when the contest is over sadly we can only pick one winnermaybe that is the one inside your head send it in ps also if you enjoy reading india uncut do remember to of the weblog awards readers are allowed to vote once every hours and the competition is tough voting is easy and just requires a single clickso head on over posted by amit varma on january in as you know my first novel my friend sancho will be published by hachette india in april and we are getting it all together right now in terms of a final edit and production details one of the areas i am keen to get right is cover design my publishers and i both felt that we needed a design that was different from the kind we see in our bookstores these days and we thought of opening it up to a much larger pool of people than a publisher would usually have access to and so with the imagined sound of trumpets and applause in the background hachette india and india uncut bring you the my friend sancho cover design competition this is how it works in the next few paragraphs i shall share a synopsis of the book and link to an excerpt that gives you a sense of the voice of the main character in the book i shall also attach hachette s official design brief for the book based on that you are invited to send in a cover design or many if you want for the book if we choose to use one of them you get rs worth of hachette books and cover credit you may not have heard of hachette before but you would certainly have heard of many of the imprints it owns such as hodder orion octopus hamlyn little brown company and orbit it is the largest general books publisher in the uk the second largest publisher in the world and had more books in the new york times bestseller list last year than any other publisherso there ll be much to choose from hachette has just launched in india and mfs will be the first release of their local list so if you win the prize you will be bewildered by the choice of books available in their catalogues here in case hachette is unable to use any of the covers submitted the first prize will not be awardedbut we will pick the design we like the most and award the designer rs worth of hachette books plus empanelment on hachette s roster of preferred designers i am hoping this does not happen and some kickass designs come in needless to say i will carry all the designs i like on india uncut and link to the designer s homepage wherever relevant and now about the book my friend sancho is a love story set in mumbai abir ganguly the protagonist is a year old cynical wise cracking journalist on the crime beat of a newspaper he is asked by his editor to do a feature story on mohammad iqbal a man killed in a police encounter as research for the story he meets iqbal s daughter muneeza an unlikely friendship forms between them but before it can become anything more certain matters need closure the first chapter of the book pdf link it will give you a sense of the tone of the book and the voice of the character but the book develops into a love story not the gritty thriller you might expect from that chapter my own brief the cover i am looking for should be one that reflects the playful young tone of the book it should attract attention from a distance without being loud or gaudy it should be classy so when you hold it you feel like taking it home with you it should be minimali hate clutter and there should not be too many elements in there what images from the book can you use well abir and muneeza have black coffee and iced tea together a couple of times and those are possible images they meet at the food court of a mall a few timesbut i do not fancy either of them being represented on the cover there is also a talking lizard in the book and he could make an appearance somewhere perhaps curling onto the spine feel free to use something abstractfor now i am more interested in the feel being right than the image being representative important point this might be the first of a series of books so you could begin with a design template that can be extended onto future books one example in indian bookstores is the series of penguin hardbacks of amitav ghosh s booksthey are clearly part of a series they are minimal with just one strong visual for each cover and they are powerful of course they are grim and convey gravitas where the covers for the abir ganguly books need to convey youth and playfulness but they work well as a series the publisher s design brief is below under the fold it is entirely written by the dudes at hachette which i find important to point out because i would never have the audacity to praise my own book also the blurbs are obviously a temporary filler posted by amit varma on december in there will be no birthday celebrations but india uncut turned four today the first post of this blog was written on december and since then i have written more than posts on this blog alone most of my blogging has been filter and comment where i link to interesting or newsworthy pieces and comment on them but i have also done a little reportage when i have been travelling on journalistic assignments as well as op ed kind of posts india uncut has changed my life in many ways i got much journalistic work because of this blog including with mint that last year it helped me polish my writing skills making my posts crisper and less self conscious and self indulgent i learnt more about the world while blogging because writing a post on most things involves a certain amount of background research i fell into many traps and in the process became aware of themsuch as the need to have an opinion on everything or to have narratives that explain every event and so on i will elaborate on this some other time many of my old posts make me cringe either in terms of how poorly they were written and how shallow the thinking behind them was but they are milestones on a journey i am still on and i am thankful for that perhaps four years from now the posts i write these days will also appall me in fact i hope they dothat will at least mean that i am getting better and there is still a point to it the biggest thing i have gained from india uncut is the readership this blog has it baffles me sometimeswhy would so many people want to read me and i am also deeply grateful for it the biggest blessing a writer can have is a sense that people are reading him and engaging with his writing i never had this sense when i wrote my column for mint or wrote pieces for wsj the guardian or even a high traffic website like cricinfo with india uncut i doand feel immensely fortunate this blog has changed over the last few yearsthere are fewer posts per day and since the time i stopped writing columns and op eds to focus on being a novelist less detailed commentary on economics or politics many of you have written in complaining about thisbut i must confess that i never felt at home being that sort of a pundit it was not my natural ground and though i am quite pleased with many of i wrote and was getting better at the form as the years went by i always felt that it was a compromise and not what i would most like to do from the time i learned to read i have wanted to be a writer of fiction telling stories over the years i have procrastinated and eventually something had to give it did this year and i finally sat my ass down and wrote a book obviously i cannot say how good it ismaybe i will look at it a few books down the line and cringe the way i do with some old iu posts but i thoroughly enjoyed writing it and felt at home that is all i want to do from now on and i am reconciled to the relative poverty that implies that said this blog was a happy accident once i got used to the medium i began to enjoy it throughly and i shall continue to blog for as long as i can or as long as my broadband connection allows me to it is immense funand with so much wtfness in the world maybe it is even necessary for me not for the world which will not change because of a few puny blog posts the nature of the blog has changed a bit over the years but i hope you will not mind the trade off once my books start coming out on that note i must inform you that blogging will remain slow for another week the deadline i mentioned for handing in the final manuscript of my friend sancho has been extended by my kind publishers by a week and i am still at work i will put up a post tomorrow with some more thoughts on the aftermath of the attacks and then take it easy we go back a long way i think you would agree and a few days do not matter no posted by amit varma on december in blogging for the rest of this week is going to be slow i need to deliver the final manuscript of my friend sancho to my publishers by november and am rewriting a portion of it that i was not quite satisfied with so i shall go easy on the surfing and blogging for the next four days though i will not lay off entirely stay tunedand subscribe to if you have not already and if the empty hours get too unbearable make a list of five things you would do today if you were going to die tomorrow and then go out and get started on one of them you can call this paanchvidaniya have fun posted by amit varma on november in righti have finalized a publisher i am pleased to announce that my first novel my friend sancho will be published by hachette india in april hachette india is part of hachette livre the world s second largest publisher who had more books than any other publisher last year in the new york times bestseller list while they are giants worldwide they have just set up shop in india they launched officially in a function in new delhi last evening my book will be the first release in their local list so all of you complaining about how i no longer write five posts a day will soon i hope see that it is been worth it meanwhile the broadband connection of the friends i am staying with in delhi is downi have cunningly managed to log on to a neighbour s wi fi just to make this important announcementso blogging will be slow for a couple of days but your patience will be rewarded posted by amit varma on november in for after miguel s book ilustrado was shortlisted he had that making it to the shortlist was like someone coming into my dark room and throwing open the curtains that seemed like a perfect simile to mewriting is a solitary act with insecurity and self doubt our closest companions and the room does seem terribly dark sometimes this prize ensures that the curtains will always remain open on miguel s work and i am delighted for him miguel and i had exchanged emails after we got and we promised to send each other signed and inscribed copies of our books now i cannot wait and when will my friend sancho be on the shelves i am going to delhi this sunday to meet all the publishers who have made me offers and finalize a deal whoever i sign with the release date is likely to be around the end of april i will announce it here within a week posted by amit varma on november in your favourite blogger has not made it there my congratulations to the writers who didi am happy for them and look forward to reading their books but if i ever find one of them walking in front of me on a promenade and i happen to have a poison tipped umbrella available i do not promise inaction excerpts of most of the longlisted works and you can check out the first chapter of my friend sancho if you feel like i have not yet decided which publisher to go withi have generous offers from three of thembut the book should be on the stands by the middle of next year updates will follow posted by amit varma on october in in a superb feature the guardian has persuaded a booker prize judge from every year to tell us the inside story of how the winner was chosen much funand much enlightenment an observation that crops up more than once is that the judges come to jury meetings with their minds made up and the rest is horse trading james wood a judge in writes t he absurdity of the process was soon apparent it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism in practice judge a blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes and then judge b blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes and nothing changes no one switches sides that is when the horse trading begins i remember that one of the judges phoned me and said in effect i know that you especially like novel x and you know that i especially like novel y it would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist yes so if you vote for my novel i will vote for yours ok that is how our shortlist was patched together and it is how our winner was chosen my first novel is on and even though i know that prizes do not make a book better or worse than it is i will be either ecstatic or heartbroken on the day the shortlist is announced the rational part of my brain tells me to not think about it to get back to that second book that i have begun to write another words or or even before i head off to bed but the roulette wheel spins and i am holding my breath posted by amit varma on september in my friend sancho is done and dusted and i resume blogging now are you happy is this what you wanted huh huh posted by amit varma on august in in of and about robert gottlieb michael crichton says in my experience of writing you generally start out with some overall idea that you can see fairly clearly as if you were standing on a dock and looking at ship on the ocean at first you can see the entire ship but then as you begin work you are in the boiler room and you cannot see the ship anymore all you can see are the pipes and the grease and the fittings of the boiler room and you have to assume the ship s exterior this is from and yes i am stuck in the boiler room wondering if this ship will stay afloat such it goes posted by amit varma on july in my first novel my friend sancho is one of the longlisted books i should call it a novel in progress actually authors were allowed to enter words of their manuscript for the prize and i made the longlist on the basis of my first three chapters i need to submit my entire manuscript by august to remain in contention for the prize and i am not quite done with it yet thus for the next few days i take a break from india uncut i know this will be hard but the rewards will be reaped by you as well so hang in there also if you are desperate for wtf entertainment there is lok sabha tv they outdo bollywood they doand it is all for real ps i will write more on my book and the process of writing it in a later postprobably at the start of august posted by amit varma on july in ',\n",

a single game involves a huge amount of luck this england side are extraordinary they are the bridge between eras leading us into a golden age of cricket i know that sounds hyperbolic so let me stun you further by saying that i give the ipl credit for this and now having woken up you up with such a jolt on this lovely sunday morning let me explain twenty cricket changed the game in two fundamental ways both ended up changing one day cricket the first was strategy when the first t games took place teams applied an odi template to innings building pinch hit build slog but this was not an optimal approach in odis teams have players over overs in t s they have players over overs the equation between resources and constraints is different this means that the cost of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball goes up critically it means that the value of aggression rises a team need not follow the odi template in some instances attacking for all overs or as i call it frontloading may be optimal west indies won the t world cup in by doing just this and england played similarly and some sides began to realise was that they had been underestimating the value of aggression in one day cricket as well the second fundamental way in which t cricket changed cricket was in terms of skills the ipl and other leagues brought big money into the game this changed incentives for budding cricketers relatively few people break into test or odi cricket and play for their countries a much wider pool can aspire to play t cricket which also provides much more money so it makes sense to spend the hundreds of hours you are in the nets honing t skills rather than test match skills go to any nets practice and you will find many more kids practising innovative aggressive strokes than playing the forward defensive as a result batsmen today have a wider array of attacking strokes than earlier generations because every run counts more in t cricket the standard of fielding has also shot up and bowlers have also reacted to this by expanding their arsenal of tricks everyone has had to lift their game in one day cricket thus two things have happened one there is better strategic understanding about the value of aggression two batsmen are better equipped to act on the aggressive imperative the game has continued to evolve bowlers have reacted to this with greater aggression on their part and this ongoing dialogue has been fascinating the cricket writer gideon haigh once told me on my podcast that the world cup featured a battle between t batting and test match bowling this england team is the high watermark so far their aggression does not come from slogging they bat with a combination of intent and skills that allows them to coast at an over without needing to take too many risks in normal conditions thus they can coast to any hitting they do beyond that is the bonus that takes them to or it is a whole new level illustrated by the fact that at one point a few days ago they had seven consecutive scores of to their name look at their scores over the last few years in fact and it is clear that this is the greatest batting side in the history of one day cricket by a margin there have been stumbles in this world cup but in the bigger picture those are outliers if england have a bad day in the final and new zealand play their a game england might even lose today but if captain morgan s men play their a game they will coast to victory new zealand does not have those gears no other team in the world does for now but one day they will all have to learn to play

new just another round on the treadmill although i would remember her fondly i thought me and cricket were done and then i fell in love again cricket has changed in the last few years in glorious ways

like this posted by amit varma on july in essays and op eds sport the rationalist this is the rd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india i had a strange dream last night i dreamt that the government had passed a law that made using laptops illegal i would have to write this column by hand i would also have to leave my home in mumbai to deliver it in person to my editor in delhi i woke up trembling and angry and realised how indian farmers feel every single day of their lives my column today is a tale of two satyagrahas both involve farmers technology and the freedom of choice one of them began this month but first let us go back to the turn of the millennium as the s came to an end cotton farmers across india were in distress pests known as bollworms were ravaging crops across the country farmers had to use increasing amounts of pesticide to keep them at bay the costs of the pesticide and the amount of labour involved made it unviable and often the crops would fail anyway then technology came to the rescue the farmers heard of bt cotton a genetically modified type of cotton that kept these pests away and was being used around the world but they were illegal in india even though no bad effects had ever been recorded well who cares about illegal when it is a matter of life and death farmers in gujarat got hold of bt cotton seeds from the black market and planted them you will never guess what happened next as began all cotton crops in gujarat failed except the hectares that had bt cotton the government did not care about the failed crops they cared about the illegal ones they ordered all the bt cotton crops to be destroyed it was time for a satyagraha and not just in gujarat the late sharad joshi leader of the shetkari sanghatana in maharashtra took around farmers to gujarat to stand with their fellows there they sat in the fields of bt cotton and basically said over our dead bodies joshi s point was simple all other citizens of india have access to the latest technology from all over they are all empowered with choice why should farmers be held back the satyagraha was successful the ban on bt cotton was lifted there are three things i would like to point out here one the lifting of the ban transformed cotton farming in india over of indian farmers now use bt cotton india has become the world s largest producer of cotton moving ahead of china according to agriculture expert ashok gulati india has gained us billion in the years since from higher exports and import savings because of bt cotton most importantly cotton farmers incomes have doubled two gmo crops have become standard across the world around million hectares of gmo crops have been planted worldwide and gmo foods are accepted in countries the humanitarian benefits have been massive golden rice a variety of rice packed with minerals and vitamins has prevented blindness in countless new born kids since it was introduced in the philippines three despite the fear mongering of some ngos whose existence depends on alarmism the science behind gmo is settled no harmful side effects have been noted in all these years and millions of lives impacted positively a couple of years ago over nobel laureates signed a petition asserting that gmo foods were safe and blasting anti science ngos that stood in the way of progress there is scientific consensus on this the science may be settled but the politics is not the government still bans some types of gmo seeds such as bt brinjal which was developed by an indian company called mahyco and used successfully in bangladesh more crucially a variety called ht bt cotton which fights weeds is also banned weeding takes up to of a farmer s time and often makes farming unviable farmers across the world use this variant of global cotton crops are ht bt indian farmers are so desperate for it that they choose to break the law and buy expensive seeds from the black market but the government is cracking down a farmer in haryana had his crop destroyed by the government in may on june this year a farmer named lalit bahale in the akola district of maharashtra kicked off a satyagraha by planting banned seeds of ht bt cotton and bt brinjal he was soon joined by thousands of farmers far from our urban eyes a heroic fight has begun our farmers already victimised and oppressed by a predatory government in countless ways are fighting for their right to take charge of their lives as this brave struggle unfolds i am left with a troubling question all those satyagrahas of the past by our great freedom fighters what were they for if all they got us was independence and not freedom posted by amit varma on june in this is the nd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india trade wars are on the rise and it is enough to get any nationalist all het up and excited earlier this week narendra modi s government that it would start imposing tariffs on us products starting today this is a response to similar treatment towards us from the us there is one thing i would invite you to consider trump and modi are not engaged in a war with each other instead they are waging war on their own people let us unpack that a bit part of the reason trump came to power is that he provided simple and wrong answers for people s problems he responded to the growing jobs crisis in middle america with two explanations one foreigners are coming and taking your jobs two your jobs are being shipped overseas both explanations are wrong but intuitive and they worked for trump he is stupid enough that he probably did not create these narratives for votes but actually believes them the first of those leads to the demonising of immigrants the second leads to a demonising of trade trump has acted on his rhetoric after becoming president and a modern us version of our old indira is india slogan might well be trump is tariff tariff is trump contrary to the fulminations of the economically illiterate all tariffs are bad without exception let me illustrate this with an example say there is a fictional product called brump a local brump costs rs foreign manufacturers appear and offer better brumps at a cheaper price say rs consumers shift to foreign brumps manufacturers of local brumps get angry and form an interest group they lobby the government or bribe it with campaign contributions to impose a tariff on import of brumps the government puts a rupee tariff the foreign brumps now cost rs and people start buying local brumps again this is a good thing right local businesses have been helped and local jobs have been saved but this is only the seen effect the unseen effect of this tariff is that millions of brump buyers would have saved rs per brump if there were no tariffs this money would have gone out into the economy been part of new demand generated more jobs everyone would have been better off and the overall standard of living would have been higher that brings to me to an essential truth about tariffs every tariff is a tax on your own people and every intervention in markets amounts to a distribution of wealth from the people at large to specific interest groups in other words from the poor to the rich the costs of this are dispersed and invisible what is rs to any of us and the benefits are large and worth fighting for local manufacturers of brumps can make crores extra much modern politics amounts to manufacturers of brumps buying politicians to redistribute money from us to them there are second order effects of protectionism as well when the us imposes tariffs on other countries those countries may respond by imposing tariffs back raw materials for many goods made locally are imported and as these become expensive so do those goods that quintessential american product the iphone uses parts from countries as local products rise in price because of expensive foreign parts prices rise demand goes down jobs are lost and everyone is worse off trump keeps talking about how he wants to win at trade but trade is not a zero sum game the most misunderstood term in our times is probably trade deficit a country has a trade deficit when it imports more than what it exports and trump thinks of that as a bad thing it is not i run a trade deficit with my domestic help and my local grocery store i buy more from them than they do from me that is fine because we all benefit it is a win win game similarly trade between countries is really trade between the people of both countries and people trade with each other because they are both better off to interfere in that process is to reduce the value created in their lives it is immoral to modify a slogan often identified with libertarians like me tariffs are theft these trade wars thus carry a touch of the absurd any leader who imposes tariffs is imposing a tax on his own people just see the chain of events trump taxes the american people in retaliation modi taxes the indian people trump raises taxes modi raises taxes nationalists in both countries cheer interests groups in both countries laugh their way to the bank what kind of idiocy is this how long will this lose lose game continue posted by amit varma on june in this is the st installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india when all political parties agree on something you know you might have a problem giriraj singh a minister in narendra modi s new cabinet that our population control law should become a movement this is something that would find bipartisan support we are taught from school onwards that india s population is a big problem and we need to control it this is wrong contrary to popular belief our population is not a problem it is our greatest strength the notion that we should worry about a growing population is an intuitive one the world has limited resources people keep increasing something s gotta give robert malthus made just this point in his book an essay on the principle of population he was worried that our population would grow exponentially while resources would grow arithmetically as more people entered the workforce wages would fall and goods would become scarce calamity was inevitable malthus s rationale was so influential that this mode of thinking was soon called malthusian it is a pejorative today a th century follower of his harrison brown came up with one of my favourite images on this subject arguing that a growing population would lead to the earth being covered completely and to a considerable depth with a writhing mass of human beings much as a dead cow is covered with a pulsating mass of maggots another malthusian paul ehrlich published a book called the population bomb in which began with the stirring lines the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now ehrlich was as you would guess a big supporter of india s coercive family planning programs i do not see he wrote how india could possibly feed two hundred million more people by none of these fears have come true a study by nicholas eberstadt called found no correlation between population density and poverty the greater the density of people the more you would expect them to fight for resources and yet monaco which has times the population density of bangladesh is doing well for itself so is bahrain which has three times the population density of india not only does population not cause poverty it makes us more prosperous the economist julian simon pointed out in a book that through history whenever there has been a spurt in population it has coincided with a spurt in productivity such as for example between malthus s time and now there were around a billion people on earth in and there are around billion today as you read these words consider that you are better off than the richest person on the planet then why is this the answer lies in the title of simon s book the ultimate resource when we speak of resources we forget that human beings are the finest resource of all there is no limit to our ingenuity and we interact with each other in positive sum ways every voluntary interactions leaves both people better off and the amount of value in the world goes up this is why we want to be part of economic networks that are as large and as dense as possible this is why most people migrate to cities rather than away from them and why cities are so much richer than towns or villages if malthusians were right essential commodities like wheat maize and rice would become relatively scarcer over time and thus more expensive but they have actually become much cheaper in real terms this is thanks to the productivity and creativity of humans who in eberstadt s words are in practice always renewable and in theory entirely inexhaustible the error made by malthus brown and ehrlich is the same error that our politicians make today and not just in the context of population zero sum thinking if our population grows and resources stays the same of course there will be scarcity but this is never the case all we need to do to learn this lesson is look at our cities this mistaken thinking has had savage humanitarian consequences in india think of the unborn millions over the decades because of our brutal family planning policies how many tendulkars rahmans and satyajit rays have we lost think of the immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country and finally think of the condescension of our politicians asserting that people are india s problem but always other people never themselves this arrogance is india s greatest problem not our people posted by amit varma on june in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india amit shah s induction into the union cabinet is such an interesting moment even partisans who oppose the bjp as i do would admit that shah is a political genius under his leadership the bjp has become an electoral behemoth in the most complicated political landscape in the world the big question that now arises is this can shah do for india what he did for the bjp this raises a perplexing question in the last five years as the bjp has flourished india has languished and yet the leadership of both the party and the nation are more or less the same then why has not the ability to manage the party translated to governing the country i would argue that there are two reasons for this one the skills required in those two tasks are different two so are the incentives in play let us look at the skills first managing a party like the bjp is in some ways like managing a large multinational company shah is a master at top down planning and micro management the elections described in detail in prashant jha s book how the bjp wins should be a harvard business school case study the book describes how he fixed the bjp s ground game in uttar pradesh picking teams for booths in uttar pradesh monitoring them and keeping them accountable shah looked at the market segmentation in up and hit upon his now famous formula he realised he could not deliver the votes of muslims yadavs and jatavs who were of the population so he focussed on wooing the other including non yadav obcs and non jatav dalits he carried out versions of these caste reconfigurations across states and according to jha covered over lakh kilometres between and consolidating market share in every state in this country he nurtured a pool of a thousand new obc and dalit leaders going well beyond the posturing of other parties that so many dalits and obcs voted for the bjp in is astonishing shah went past mandal politics managing to subsume previously antagonistic castes and sub castes into a broad hindutva identity and as the bjp increased its depth it expanded its breadth as well what it has done in west bengal wiping out the left and weakening mamata banerjee is jaw dropping with hindsight it may one day seem inevitable but only a madman could have conceived it and only a genius could have executed it good man to be home minister then eh not quite a country is not like a large company or even a political party it is much too complex to be managed from the top down and a control freak is bound to flounder the approach needed is very different some tasks of governance it is true are tailor made for efficient managers building infrastructure taking care of roads and power building toilets even without an underlying drainage system and pr campaigns can all be executed by good managers but the deeper tasks of making an economy flourish require a different approach they need a light touch not a heavy hand the th century is full of cautionary tales that show that economies cannot be centrally planned from the top down examples of that fatal conceit to use my hero friedrich hayek s term include the soviet union mao s china and even the lady modi most reminds me of indira gandhi the task of the state when it comes to the economy is to administer a strong rule of law and to make sure it is applied equally no special favours to cronies or special interest groups just unleash the natural creativity of the people and do not try to micro manage sadly the bjp s impulse like that of most governments of the past is a statist one india should have a small state that does a few things well instead we have a large state that does many things badly and acts as a parasite on its people as it happens the few things that we should do well are all right up shah s managerial alley for example the rule of law is effectively absent in india today especially for the poor as home minister shah could fix this if he applied the same zeal to governing india as he did to growing the bjp but will he and here we come to the question of incentives what drives amit shah maximising power or serving the nation what is good for the country will often coincide with what is good for the party but not always when they diverge which path will shah choose so much rests on that posted by amit varma on june in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a friend of mine was very impressed by the interview narendra modi granted last week to akshay kumar such a charming man such great work ethic he gushed he is the kind of uncle i would want my kids to have and then in the same breath he asked how can such a good man be such a bad prime minister i do not want to be uncharitable and suggest that modi s image is entirely manufactured so let us take the interview at face value let us also grant modi his claims about the purity of his neeyat intentions and reframe the question this way when it comes to public policy why do good intentions often lead to bad outcomes to attempt an answer i will refer to a story a friend of mine who knows modi well once told me about him modi was chilling with his friends at home more than a decade ago and told them an incident from his childhood his mother was ill once and the young narendra was tending to her the heat was enervating so the boy went to the switchboard to switch on the fan but there was no electricity my friend said that as he told this story modi s eyes filled with tears even after all these years he was moved by the memory my friend used this story to make the point that modi s vision of the world is experiential if he experiences something he understands it when he became chief minister of gujarat he made it his stated mission to get reliable electricity to every part of gujarat no doubt this was shaped by the time he flicked a switch as a young boy and the fan did not budge similarly he has given importance to things like roads and cleanliness since he would have experienced the impact of those as a young man my term for him inspired by rajat kapoor s film is the ankhon dekhi prime minister at one level this is a good thing he sees a problem and works for the rest of his life to solve it but what of things he cannot experience the economy is a complex beast as is society itself and beyond a certain level you need to grasp abstract concepts to understand how the world works you cannot experience them for example spontaneous order or the idea that society and markets like language cannot be centrally directed or planned or the positive sum nature of things which is the engine of our prosperity the idea that every transaction is a win win game and that for one person to win another does not have to lose or indeed respect for individual rights and free speech one understands abstract concepts by reading about them understanding them applying them to the real world modi is not known to be a reader and this is not his fault given his background it is a near miracle that he has made it this far he was not born into a home with a reading culture and did not have either the resources or the time when he was young to devote to reading the only way he could learn about the world thus was by experiencing it there are two lessons here one for modi himself and others in his position and another for everyone the lesson in this for modi is a lesson for anyone who rises to such an important position even if he is the smartest person in the world that lesson is to have humility about the bounds of your knowledge and to surround yourself with experts who can advise you well be driven by values and not confidence in your own knowledge gather intellectual giants around you and stand on their shoulders modi did not do this in the case of demonetisation which he carried out against the advice of every expert he consulted we all know the damage it caused to the economy the other learning from this is for all of us how do we make sense of the world by connecting dots an ankhon dekhi approach will get us very few dots and our view of the world will be blurred and incomplete the best way to gather more dots is reading the more we read the better we understand the world and the better the decisions we take when we can experience a thousand lives through books why restrict ourselves to one a good man with noble intentions can make bad decisions with horrible consequences the only way to hedge against this is by staying humble and reading more so when you finish reading this piece think of an unread book that you would like to read today and read it posted by amit varma on may in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the man who gave us our national anthem rabindranath tagore once wrote that nationalism was a great menace he went on to say it is the particular thing which for years has been at the bottom of india s troubles not just india s but the world s in his book the open society and its enemies published in as adolf hitler was defeated karl popper ripped into nationalism with all its appeals to our tribal instincts to passion and to prejudice and to our nostalgic desire to be relieved from the strain of individual responsibility which it attempts to replace by a collective or group responsibility nationalism is resurgent today stomping across the globe hand in hand with populism in india too it is tearing us apart but must nationalism always be a bad thing a provocative new book by the israeli thinker yael tamir argues otherwise in her book why nationalism tamir makes the following arguments one nation states are here to stay two the state needs the nation to be viable three people need nationalism for the sense of community and belonging it gives them four therefore we need to build a better nationalism which brings people together instead of driving them apart the first point needs no elaboration we are a globalised world but we are also trapped by geography and circumstance only percent of the world s population tamir points out lives outside their country of birth nutopia the borderless state dreamed up by john lennon and yoko ono is not happening anytime soon if the only thing that citizens of a state have in common is geographical circumstance it is not enough if the state is a necessary construct a nation is its necessary justification political institutions crave to form long term political bonding writes tamir and for that matter they must create a community that is neither momentary nor meaningless nationalism she says endows the state with intimate feelings linking the past the present and the future more pertinently tamir argues people need nationalism i am a humanist with a belief in individual rights but tamir says that this is not enough the term human is a far too thin mode of delineation she writes individuals need to rely on thick identities to make their lives meaningful this involves a shared past a common culture and distinctive values tamir also points out that there is a strong correlation between social class and political preferences the privileged elites can afford to be globalists but those less well off are inevitably drawn to other narratives that enrich their lives rather than seeing nationalism as the last refuge of the scoundrel writes tamir we should start thinking of nationalism as the last hope of the needy tamir s book bases its arguments on the west but the argument holds in india as well in a country with so much poverty is it any wonder that nationalism is on the rise the cosmopolitan globe trotting elites do not have daily realities to escape but how are those less fortunate to find meaning in their lives i have one question though why is our nationalism so exclusionary when our nation is so inclusive in the nationalism that our ruling party promotes there are some communities who belong here and others who do not and even among those who belong they exploit divisions in their us vs them vision of the world some religions are foreign some values are foreign even some culinary traditions are foreign and therefore frowned upon but the india i know and love is just the opposite of that we embrace influences from all over our language our food our clothes our music our cinema have absorbed so many diverse influences that to pretend they come from a single legit source is absurd even the elegant churidar kurtas our prime minister wears have an islamic origin as an example take the recent film gully boy its style of music the clothes its protagonists wear even the attitudes in the film would have seemed alien to us a few decades ago and yet could there be a truer portrait of young india this inclusiveness this joyous khichdi that we are is what makes our nation a model for the rest of the world no nation embraces all other nations as ours does my india celebrates differences and i do as well i wear my kurta with jeans i listen to ghazals i eat dhansak and kababs and i dream in the indian language called english this is my nationalism those who try to divide us therefore are the true anti nationals we must reclaim nationalism from them posted by amit varma on april in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india one of my favourite english words comes from chess if it is your turn to move but any move you make makes your position worse you are in zugzwang narendra modi was in zugzwang after the pulwama attacks a few days agoas any indian prime minister in his place would have been an indian pm after an attack for which pakistan is held responsible has only unsavoury choices in front of him he is pulled in two opposite directions one strategy dictates that he must not escalate two politics dictates that he must let us unpack that first consider the strategic imperatives ever since both india and pakistan became nuclear powers a conventional war has become next to impossible because of the threat of a nuclear war if india escalates beyond a point pakistan might bring their nuclear weapons into play even a limited nuclear war could cause millions of casualties and devastate our economy thus no matter what the provocation india needs to calibrate its response so that the pakistan does not take it all the way it is impossible to predict what actions pakistan might view as sufficient provocation so india has tended to play it safe do not capture territory do not attack military assets do not kill civilians in other words surgical strikes on alleged terrorist camps is the most we can do given that pakistan knows that it is irrational for india to react and our leaders tend to be rational they can bleed us with a thousand cuts as their doctrine states with impunity both in when our parliament was attacked and the bjp s atal bihari vajpayee was pm and in when mumbai was attacked and the congress s manmohan singh was pm our leaders considered all the options on the tablebut were forced to do nothing but is doing nothing an option in an election year leave strategy aside and turn to politics india has been attacked forty soldiers have been killed and the nation is traumatised and baying for blood it is now politically impossible to not retaliateespecially for a pm who has criticized his predecessor for being weak and portrayed himself as a inch chested man of action i have no doubt that modi is a rational man and knows the possible consequences of escalation but he also knows the possible consequences of not escalatinghe could dilute his brand and lose the elections thus he is forced to act and after he acts his pakistan counterpart will face the same domestic pressure to retaliate and will have to attack back and so on till my home in versova is swallowed up by a nuclear crater right well not exactly there is a way to resolve this paradox india and pakistan can both escalate not via military actions but via optics modi and imran khan who you would expect to feel like the loneliest men on earth right now can find sweet company in each other their incentives are aligned neither man wants this to turn into a full fledged war both men want to appear macho in front of their domestic constituencies both men are masters at building narratives and have a pliant media that will help them thus india can carry out a surgical strike and claim it destroyed a camp killed terrorists and forced pakistan to return a braveheart prisoner of war pakistan can say india merely destroyed two trees plus a rock and claim the high moral ground by returning the prisoner after giving him good masala tea a benign military equilibrium is maintained and both men come out looking like strong leaders a win win game for the pms that avoids a lose lose game for their nations they can give themselves a high five in private when they meet next and imran can whisper to modi you are a good spinner bro there is one problem here though what if the optics do not work if modi feels that his public is too sceptical and he needs to do more he might feel forced to resort to actual military escalation the fog of politics might obscure the possible consequences if the resultant indian military action causes serious

could we also check out amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen episode of the seen and the unseen posted by amit varma on march in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india steven pinker in his book enlightenment now relates an old russian joke about two peasants named boris and igor they are both poor boris has a goat igor does not one day igor is granted a wish by a visiting fairy what will he wish for i wish he says that boris s goat should die the joke ends there revealing as much about human nature as about economics consider the three things that happen if the fairy grants the wish one boris becomes poorer two igor stays poor three inequality reduces is any of them a good outcome i feel exasperated when i hear intellectuals and columnists talking about economic inequality it is my contention that india s problem is poverty and that poverty and inequality are two very different things that often do not coincide to illustrate this i sometimes ask this question in which of the following countries would you rather be poor usa or bangladesh the obvious answer is usa where the poor are much better off than the poor of bangladesh and yet while bangladesh has greater poverty the usa has higher inequality indeed take a look at the countries of the world measured by the gini index which is that standard metric used to measure inequality and you will find that usa hong kong singapore and the united kingdom all have greater inequality than bangladesh liberia pakistan and sierra leone which are much poorer and yet while the poor of bangladesh would love to migrate to unequal usa i do not hear of too many people wishing to go in the opposite direction indeed people vote with their feet when it comes to choosing between poverty and inequality all of human history is a story of migration from rural areas to cities which have greater inequality if poverty and inequality are so different why do people conflate the two a key reason is that we tend to think of the world in zero sum ways for someone to win someone else must lose if the rich get richer the poor must be getting poorer and the presence of poverty must be proof of inequality but that is not how the world works the pie is not fixed economic growth is a positive sum game and leads to an expansion of the pie and everybody benefits in absolute terms the rich get richer and so do the poor often enough to come out of poverty and so in any growing economy as poverty reduces inequality tends to increase this is counter intuitive i know so used are we to zero sum thinking this is exactly what has happened in india since we liberalised parts of our economy in most people who complain about inequality in india are using the wrong word and are really worried about poverty put a millionaire in a room with a billionaire and no one will complain about the inequality in that room but put a starving beggar in there and the situation is morally objectionable it is the poverty that makes it a problem not the inequality you might think that this is just semantics but words matter poverty and inequality are different phenomena with opposite solutions you can solve for inequality by making everyone equally poor or you could solve for it by redistributing from the rich to the poor as if the pie was fixed the problem with this as any economist will tell you is that there is a trade off between redistribution and growth all redistribution comes at the cost of growing the pie and only growth can solve the problem of poverty in a country like ours it has been estimated that in india for every one percent rise in gdp two million people come out of poverty that is a stunning statistic when millions of indians do not have enough money to eat properly or sleep with a roof over their heads it is our moral imperative to help them rise out of poverty the policies that will make this possible allowing free markets incentivising investment and job creation removing state oppression are likely to lead to greater inequality so what it is more urgent to make sure that every indian has enough to fulfil his basic needs what the philosopher harry frankfurt in his fine book on inequality called the doctrine of sufficiency the elite in their airconditioned drawing rooms and those who live in rich countries can follow the fashions of the west and talk compassionately about inequality india does not have that luxury posted by amit varma on february in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india it is election season and promises are raining down on voters like rose petals on naive newlyweds earlier this week the congress party announced a minimum income guarantee for the poor this friday the modi government released a budget full of sops as the days go by the promises will get bolder and you might feel important that so much attention is being given to you well the joke is on you every election hl mencken once said is an advance auction sale of stolen goods a bunch of competing mafias fight to rule over you for the next five years you decide who wins on the basis of who can bribe you better with your own money this is an absurd situation which i tried to express in a couple of years ago politics a neta who loves currency notes told me what his line of work denotes it is kind of funny we steal people s money and use some of it to buy their votes we are the dupes here and we pay far more to keep this circus going than this circus costs it would be okay if the parties once they came to power provided good governance but voters have given up on that and now only want patronage and handouts that leads to one of the biggest problems in indian politics we are stuck in an equilibrium where all good politics is bad economics and vice versa for example the minimum guarantee for the poor is good politics because the optics are great it is basically garibi hatao that slogan made indira gandhi a political juggernaut in the s at the same time that she unleashed a series of economic policies that kept millions of people in garibi for decades longer than they should have been this time the congress has released no details and keeping it vague makes sense because i find it hard to see how it can make economic sense depending on how they define poor how much income they offer and what the cost is the plan will either be ineffective or unworkable the modi government s interim budget announced a handout for poor farmers that seemed rather pointless given our agricultural distress offering a poor farmer bucks a month seems almost like mockery such condescending handouts solve nothing the poor want jobs and opportunities those come with growth which requires structural reforms structural reforms do not sound sexy as election promises handouts do a classic example is farm loan waivers we have reached a stage in our politics where every party has to promise them to assuage farmers who are a strong vote bank everywhere you cannot blame farmers for wanting them they are a necessary anaesthetic but no government has yet made a serious attempt at tackling of our agricultural crisis why is it that good politics in india is always bad economics let me put forth some possible reasons one voters tend to think in zero sum ways as if the pie is fixed and the only way to bring people out of poverty is to redistribute the truth is that trade is a positive sum game and nations can only be lifted out of poverty when the whole pie grows but this is unintuitive two indian politics revolves around identity and patronage the spoils of power are limited that is indeed a zero sum game so you are likely to vote for whoever can look after the interests of your in group rather than care about the economy as a whole three voters tend to stay uninformed for good reasons because of what public choice economists call rational ignorance a single vote is unlikely to make a difference in an election so why put in the effort to understand the nuances of economics and governance just ask what is in it for me and go with whatever seems to be the best answer four politicians have a short term horizon geared towards winning the next election a good policy that may take years to play out is unattractive a policy that will win them votes in the short term is preferable sadly no indian party has shown a willingness to aim for the long term the congress has produced new gandhis but not new ideas and while the bjp did make some solid promises in they did not walk that talk and have proved to be as arun shourie once called them upa cow even the congress is adopting the cow in fact so maybe the bjp will add temple to that mix benjamin franklin once said democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch this election season my friends the people of india are on the menu you have been deveined and deboned marinated with rhetoric seasoned with narrative now enter the oven and vote posted by amit varma on february in a slightly shorter version of this was published as the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india whenever the pressures of the world get too much for me i lighten the burden by going over to donald trump s twitter feed trump the only president who would fail the turing test keeps lashing out at opponents and saying outrageous things often in all caps the internet version of screaming it is wonderfully entertaining and got even more so when he lashed out at narendra modi last week trump said i could give you an example where i get along very well with india and prime minister modi but he is constantly telling me he built a library in afghanistan library that is like five hours of what we spend and he tells me he is very smart we are supposed to say oh thank you for the library do not know who is using it in afghanistan modi fanbois also tend to be trump fanbois because they like macho men and this must have been confusing to them at multiple levels one why was trump lashing out at modi two if trump is telling the truth why does modi keep boasting about building a library three what library after much googling in the pmo our officials figured that despite having spent over us billion in afghanistan since we had not built a library maybe trump confused the parliament building with a library but it was unlikely that modi would boast to trump even about that especially constantly so trump was lying right no trump was not lying i say he was bullshitting i am not just dropping slang here bullshit may appear to be a pejorative but it has become a technical term after the philosopher harry frankfurt published his seminal book on bullshit in and if we are to understand the likes of trump it is important to understand the distinction between bullshit and lies a liar as per frankfurt acknowledges the truth and aims to deceive for a bullshitter the truth is irrelevant bullshitters aim not to deceive but are just winging it saying whatever comes into their head at a given point in time which may or may not be true for trump everything comes down to how macho he is and how others are messing around at america s expense and only he can stop them his boast about modi constantly talking to him about a library was in this vein he could also have said that modi wears ladies underwear or modi begged him to open a casino in lutyen s delhi or modi wore a suit with his name on it any relationship that bullshit has with the truth is usually coincidental trump bullshits a lot and then doubles down on his bullshit once he has released it for example the wall that mexico will pay for i am sure he was winging it when he first came up with it ironically his latest target is a master bullshitter himself when modi spoke of the first plastic surgery in india being done on lord ganesha or climate change being a consequence of people getting older he was not lying but bullshitting he is not educated or knowledgeable enough to know the truth in any of those cases so it does not matter to him and it seems not to matter to any of us either politicians can get away with bullshit and lying because people do not care about facts we tend to form echo chambers with like minded people form whatever worldview appeals to us and shut ourselves off from conflicting views behavioural scientists point to hard wiring in the brain that strengthens this process the confirmation bias ensures that we only consider facts that agree with our worldview and ignore the rest the backfire effect worryingly for fact checkers ensures that our worldviews actually grow stronger when we are presented with conflicting evidence these echo chambers once formed tend to grow more and more strident experiments by social scientists have found that when people with similar opinions are thrown together in a group they tend to take decisions more extreme than any one individual would take this is known as group polarisation you see this in social media where discourse is polarised and opposing sides are talking past each other not to each other with every individual performing to impress his own side when all discourse takes place along tribal lines rhetoric matters facts do not is bullshit a feature or a bug an entire nation will vote upon it this year as india goes to the polls narendra modi has focussed entirely on optics and not on performance betting that once people have formed a narrative inside their heads facts are irrelevant is an a in campaigning more important than a f in governance we will soon find out what the people of india think posted by amit varma on january in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the late farmer leader sharad joshi used to enjoy reciting a poem that described the indian farmer s plight perfectly it addresses the non farmer from the farmer s point of view and it goes marte hum bhi hain marte tum bhi ho marte hum bhi hain marte tum bhi ho hum sasta bech ke marte hain tum mahanga khareedke marte ho i would translate it thus i die my friend and so do you i die my friend and so do you i sell my produce cheap and die you pay so much that you die too this beautiful shair expresses an old truth that many investigative journalists wrote about anew this week as protesting farmers congregated on delhi the gap between what farmers get for their produce and what the consumer pays one report revealed that a farmer sold tomatoes at rs per kg and consumers bought them for rs too little and too much both the farmers and consumers were getting killed by this just like in the poem joshi s insight in the late s was that this was caused not by the greed of middlemen but the interference of the indian state the state had set forth rules that the farmer could not sell his produce in an open market responding to supply and demand but only to a government appointed body called the agricultural produce market committee apmc because the farmers are not allowed to sell to anyone else they are forced to take the price offered to them and because all produce comes through the apmc buyers also have no bargaining power now imagine what would happen if the free market was allowed to operate middlemen would compete to buy goods from farmers and that competition would ensure that farmers would get a better price they would also compete for customers this ensuring that customers would pay less instead of farmers selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs you could have the farmer selling for rs and the consumer buying for rs both farmer and consumer would benefit by rs per kg but the government does not allow this and both farmers and consumers get hurt joshi referred to this notional cost paid by the farmer as a negative subsidy he viewed it correctly as theft the issue here is not that farmers are hard up and the government is not helping them the issue is that the government is responsible for the poverty of the farmer and is stealing from him and this is not the only way that the government is crippling our farmers farmers are not allowed access to markets in anything they do the state does not allow free markets in inputs because of which many of the inputs a farmer needs from seeds to fertilisers to energy to even credit are either hard to come by or of a low quality and when they do manage to produce crops they are not allowed to get the best price for it as an open market would enable by denying them freedom the state effectively imprisons our farmers in what a friend of mine calls ppp perpetually planned poverty this extends not just to their produce but to their property farmers are not allowed to sell their land for non agricultural purposes this restricts their market to other farmers and ensures that the price they can get for their land is so low that it becomes pointless to sell it has been estimated that some farmland would be forty times as valuable if this law did not exist indeed a common scam is for a crony of the state to acquire land from farmers through the state at low prices and then get the land use certificate changed so that they can sell at many multiples of that price all perfectly legal and deeply unethical this is how robert vadra was alleged to have made his money in fact every political party in our history has let our farmers down but there is a reason things are coming to a head now india is already facing a jobs crisis made worse by the deepening of the agricultural crisis with every generation land holdings get smaller one farmer s land is split among multiple children and more and more unsustainable it is no coincidence that many recent popular uprisings have been around demand for jobs from land owning castes like like jats patidars and marathas indian agriculture has been in crisis for decades more than of our country is in the agricultural sector producing of our gdp in developing countries less than of the population works in agriculture here we have trapped our farmers in poverty and also not allowed the industrial revolution that would have provided an escape route we pay lip service to farmers but instead of making the necessary structural reforms we give handouts like farm loan waivers that provide only temporary relief it is like handing aspirin to a burning man here we say take this for the pain and everybody claps also check out epsiode of the seen and the unseen

the collected writings of sharad joshi posted by amit varma on december in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india this has been a year of glorious gifts from unelected middle aged men the supreme court of india is churning out enlightened judgements as if oppression is going out of fashion privacy and now adultery on thursday the court struck down section of the indian penal code this section read whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man without the consent or connivance of that man such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape is guilty of the offense of adultery and shall be punished as the part about the consent of the husband indicates the law treated women as the property of their husbands and adultery like a form of theft justice dy chandrachud wrote in his judgement the history of section reveals that the law on adultery was for the benefit of the husband for him to secure ownership over the sexuality of his wife it was aimed at preventing the woman from exercising her sexual agency as chandrachud elaborates in his judgement this has been a ubiquitous attitude towards adultery throughout history babylon s ancient hammurabi code prescribed that a married woman caught in adultery be bound to her lover and thrown into the water so that they drown together no such punishment for an unfaithful man mind you ancient greco roman societies considered adultery to be a violation of a husband s exclusive sexual access to his wife and judaic and christian laws followed a similar logic this went beyond ancient times in england introduced the death penalty for adultery with the act for suppressing the detestable sins of incest adultery and fornication section which they later thrust upon this particular colony was an adulterated version of this in the st century no law should deny the autonomy and agency of a woman but what if society itself is regressive and denies women basic human dignity as is the case in india chandrachud remarks law and society are intrinsically connected and oppressive social values often find expression in legal structures but he adds the constitution both in text and interpretation has played a significant role in the evolution of law from being an instrument of oppression to becoming one of liberation one bad law has gone but we remain a nation in which women are second class citizens firstly similar laws remain in the books such as section which deals with enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman and also treats women as the property of men secondly hell look at indian society around you some of us engish speaking elite types imagine that things must be getting better because we see so many strong articulate women around us but that is the selection bias at play outside these circles women in india are having a tough time women still fill government forms that insist on father s husbands name as if to establish ownership one telling metric female participation in the workforce has actually gone down in the last two decades much of what we call empowerment is on the terms of men so many men signal how modern they are by boasting about how they let their wife work or how they help out with domestic chores they behave as if they deserve a pat of their backs for not beating their wives and chaining them to the kitchen we have set the bar so low that not being a monster is now a matter of congratulations men tend to be oblivious of how women carry their gender as a burden something i realised recently and shame on me for being so late to realise it in my forties is that my gender is not a factor in my everyday life i can ignore and take for granted my maleness but in every single thing a woman does her gender comes into play an empty compartment at a train station the tone of voice in a job interview the supercilious sniggering men who always interrupt whose eyes travel like you know their hands would if they had the license every day women have to confront and make peace with their own thingness every day they find new reasons to question themselves the ever present human anxiety about what others think of us is amplified for women and restraint becomes a reflex i have a secondary rant here just as the adultery law saw women as the property of men many of our laws and parts of our constitution treat citizens as the property of the state we are subjects of a mai baap master which can regulate our speech and our behaviour we take this for granted just as many women take the oppression they face for granted we cannot be a free society until we address this the supreme court cannot deliver us from ourselves no matter how ugly the sight we must look within also check out amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen amit varma amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen posted by amit varma on september in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india remember remember the sixth of september in many ways this date in is as momentous as august was on that day india gained freedom from a foreign ruler but indians remained unfree subjects of an oppressive indian state instead of an oppressive colonial one we were denied so many types of freedom and took that condition for granted this week though an important sliver of liberty was finally handed to us this is also independence day the repeal of section is an emotional victory but the tears are bittersweet the fact remains that it took five unelected men to set this right in this great democracy of ours where the voice of the people is supposed to find expression in its politics not one political party in the last years tried to repeal parties do not have principles only incentives and all of them behaved this way because they feared that voters would not approve that tells you what every gay person in this country already knows from lived experience our society is homophobic not just that our society and the state do not give a damn about consent the central principle of this judgement was consent no one has the right to come between two consenting adults consent is the foundation of all human rights and should be the foundation of our republic and yet despite this one historic judgement on one domain of consent we remain a land that does not care for this principle consider the arts we are a country where films made for adults by adults are routinely censored books are banned objectionable art exhibitions are shut down or vandalised artists and patrons consenting adults all are prevented from enriching each other consider free speech as in any other marketplace all of us benefit when there is competition in the marketplace of ideas and yet we have laws in the indian penal code like a and a which allow anyone to claim offence and shut free speech down like these laws are colonial artefacts but they are actually validated by the most illiberal part of our constitution article which allows caveats to free speech on grounds like public order and decency and morality those are open to interpretation and anything goes consider food the government regulates what you may or may not eat consider health you cannot take cannabis for medical use or any other medicine not approved by a government body consider education you could get arrested for home schooling your children if you find government schools inadequate and there are so many restrictions placed on private schools that come between consenting parents and consenting teachers indeed markets are as big a battleground for consent as bedrooms or kitchens if we do not interfere between consenting adults in a bedroom or kitchen what moral justification is there for doing so in the marketplace every time a voluntary exchange happens between two people it does so because both people benefit life and markets are a positive sum game and yet governments regulate and stop voluntary exchanges between consenting adults all the time often acting on behalf of entrenched interests they restrict competition harming consumers aka citizens and benefiting cronies the most poignant victims of this are our farmers our entire agricultural crisis is a result of our farmers having their autonomy snatched away from them they are the least free of indians and are trapped in a cycle of dependency but this is a subject for another column perhaps years after the british left is we have the mentality of the colonised we behave as if we are subjects of a mai baap state and not its masters the state should exist to serve us not the other way around we give the state a monopoly on violence so that it can protect our rights not so that it takes them away with the threat of violence it is not a safeguard for our liberty but the biggest threat to it we got lucky this time with the supreme court ruling but we cannot rely on the court every time there are too many freedoms to fight for and unless the parties that run this country see political capital in it they will not grant us those freedoms but i have hope the outpouring of joy at the repeal of may indicate that things are changing have we started caring about each other and about freedom a little bit more are we beginning to recognise that a nation cannot truly be free until all its citizens are free are we going to bring about more trysts with destiny posted by amit varma on september in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a debate has been conducted in india since the kerala floods broke not through words but through actions two different ideas of india are being debated they are opposite ideas and we will soon be called upon to choose one of them to get a sense of the first idea consider the countless heroes who stepped up in kerala to help the countless victims as the water levels rose as homes were submerged and livelihoods destroyed fisherfolk from across the state turned their boats inwards to help the most enduring image jaisal kp a fisherman from mallapuram bending and offering his back as a ramp for rescued people getting on a boat thousands of volunteers from across the country even as far away as kashmir turned up to volunteer at relief camps those locals who escaped the worst of it stopped their onam shopping to buy relief materials instead thousands donated to the chief minister s relief fund including an eight year girl who had been saving for four years to buy a bicycle she donated every rupee in the town of suntikoppa the local church temple and madarsa turned into relief camps coordinating with each other as if to say our religion is humanity what is this idea of india it is the idea that we are one people we celebrate our differences but we recognise that what holds us together is stronger than anything that pulls us apart in this india when the water level rises no one will ask what your religion caste language state cuisine or ideology is they will offer you their hand or their boat or their bicycle the other idea of india is filled with hate and anger one man claimed this was god s punishment on kerala because menstruating women had been allowed into the sabarimala temple another claimed that it was god s punishment on kerala s muslims and christians for well not being hindu another appeal went out for donations only to go to hindu organisations which would help only hindus there were those who wanted not only to gloat on kerala s misfortune but to prevent it from getting help a gentleman who was later revealed to be a member of the bjp it cell put out a viral video saying that since kerala did not have too many poor people there was no need to donate another man in an army uniform gave a similar message only for the army to then declare that the fellow was an imposter in all this the hindutva whatsapp factories were active they circulated images supposedly of rss people distributing relief though some of them turned out to be of non rss people including from the communist parties and the others were old recycled pictures will not help will not allow others to help will take credit anyway this was also the story of the central government when the kerala government asked for aid the narendra modi government gave a pittance a fraction of what had been asked for and what they had given other states for smaller tragedies when speculation spread that the uae government had offered rs crores as relief the modi government said it would not allow the money to go from willing donor to needy recipient yes really this is the second idea of india here we are divided by religion caste region language we feel schadenfreude not sympathy at the pain of others here it is a zero sum game and we like to see others fall as only their falling will help us rise i call this the tukde tukde vision of india people who think in terms of divisions who foment hate among their own peoplewhat else can one call them but anti national they are betraying both the inclusive entities they claim to speak for hinduism and india i consider them a greater threat to our nation than any terrorism from across the border it is true that all indian politics is identity politics every government we have ever had every party that exists today has let this nation down but this ruling party and the entire hindutva movement has hit new lows with the way they actively tried to prevent aid from reaching kerala such malice why the people they let down were not just the people of kerala but the citizens of india from across the country the rest of us were watching and deciding which of these two ideas of india is dear to us and just as this debate unfolded through actions we can make our choice clear through action vote wisely next year posted by amit varma on august in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india there was outrage on twitter this week when it was revealed that the union government had since on government advertising the outrage is justifiedbut it is not enough it is not just this amount or this use of government money that we should question but the whole concept of government spending and indeed government action we in india seem to think of government as the solution to all our problems i often argue that india s biggest religion is not hinduism but the religion of government we behave as if the state is a benevolent entity with unlimited resources of its own with which it should fulfil all our wishes ban what we do not like build what we want built spend on what we think are good causes statues loan waivers awards for sportspeople ministries for cow protection and so on in all this we ignore one essential truth every act of government is an act of violence think about what the state needs in order to exist our taxes money taken from us by force no one pays taxes willingly without the threat of imprisonmentbasically abduction by the one entity that has a monopoly on violencethere would be no taxpayers there are two words that mean the act of taking someone s property without their consent no wonder people say that taxation is theft indeed it is more than that assume that you pay of your income in taxes that amounts to one fourth of your time and labour it means that for all practical purposes from january to march every year you are a slave to the state taxation is not just theft it is part time slavery contrary to a common canard everybody pays taxes taxes are not just income tax your domestic help is parted from her money when she buys a bar of soap the beggar at the traffic signal near you loses money to the government every time he buys salt even inflationusually caused by the government printing moneyis basically a tax on the poor i am not arguing that we should pay no taxes and live in anarchy the state is a necessary evil we need it to protect our rights and there is no way around the paradox that by allowing it to exist we give away some of our rights the state has to tax us to protect us and the violence it thus commits is necessary to protect us from greater violence regardless of what your ideology may be none of what i have said above is contestable it is plain fact that no one pays taxes willingly and that the threat of coercion is involved it is plain fact thus that every government action involves violence and coercion most people would also accept that some amount of this violence is necessary for we need the state to protect our rights the larger question then is what actions of the state are justified given the violence involved at every step this is where ideology begins person one a libertarian like me could argue for a minimal state that only protects our rights and nothing else if you feel the state should do other things give me the moral justification for your preferences being funded by money coercively taken from others person two may advocate a state looking after its less fortunate members proving free healthcare and education person three may care about national glory and want to build grand statues person four could argue that building infrastructure is necessary and has positive externalities it is beside the point of course that political parties are driven by imperatives beyond ideology they need money and votes to exist and win and when in power use the state as a tool to reward those who gave them money and votesalways at the expense of us citizens the purpose of this column is not to argue for or against any of those ideologies i just ask that every time you advocate government action of any kind remember that the action comes at a cost that cost is not just a financial cost but a moral one that cost involves violence committed on all of usnot just rich industrialists but also the poorest of the poor can you justify that violence posted by amit varma on august in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india would aditi mittal have become a stand up comedian had she not studied in a girls college appearing as a guest in of my weekly podcast she told me that studying at sophia college enabled her to perform in front of others with confidence had there been boys in her class she said she would not have been able to claim the space of the class jester this came as a revelation to me though it should not have no male comedian would have experienced this but every woman knows what it is like aditi s point was that even though she was so privilegedborn to english speaking liberal parentsshe began her career facing obstacles her male peers never considered at least she made it through there are million people who did not one reason for india being such a poor country is that we treat half of our greatest resourceour peopleas inferior to the other half this has a huge cost which people have recently begun to quantify here are some numbers only of indian women are in the workforce next only to saudi arabia among g countries in the latest issue of the economist reveals that if female labour participation was as much as of that of men there would be an additional million women in the workforce even many of those who do work now would be more skilled and productive if treated equally with their brothers in childhood according to a mckinsey study our gdp could go up by by if female participation in the workforce matched that of men for more read in indiaspend india s misogyny carries much more than just an economic cost it is a humanitarian tragedy no other term suffices when more than half a billion people are treated as subhuman and prevented from reaching their full potential a recent study named india as the most dangerous country in the world for women which is no surprise given that women are essentially treated as the property of men these cultural attitudes are that take this approach even though we live in the st century our attitudes towards women belong in the th we must fix this let me declare it upfront i am a feminist and because that particular f word has so many shades of meaning let me define what i mean by it feminism is the belief that women deserve the same respect as individuals that men do the same moral consideration the same legal rights my feminism arises out of my belief in the primacy of individual rights with consent as an absolute value indeed i tell my fellow libertarians that to be libertarian is by default to be feminist a male friend of mine even says if you are not feminist you are not a good human being why does feminism get a bad rap then this is because just as there are all kinds of human beings there are all kinds of feminists not all stop at the principle of equal rights and offshoots of feminism can often contradict each other google gender feminism vs equity feminism many feminists feed into an identity politics in vogue today which can be as toxic as the ills it purports to be fighting also the tactics that some feminists employ can make some uncomfortable such as the recent list of alleged sexual offenders in academia who were to be deemed guilty until proven innocent but even that list had an important function which is the same one that the metoo movement highlights women are angry and will not put up with this shit any more men seem to be oblivious to the extent and ubiquity of this anger as well as to the fact that it is justified indeed one central cultural disconnect of our times can be summed up like this women are angry men are clueless this is made worse by the fact that many men who declare themselves to be feminists are just being performative basically virtue signalling to get laid as men are hardwired to do i find this irritating but i will not turn away from declaring my feminism either because of this or because of my discomfort with the tactics of some feminists the reason for this is twofold one women being treated as second class citizens hurts us all and diminishes us as human beings two it is a sad truth that because of the power dynamics around us men can actually make more of a difference than women can especially when outspoken women are being constantly minimised and mocked therefore it is imperative for us men to also fight this good fight not because of what our ancestors did or how our fellow men behave but because it is the right thing to do also check out episode of the seen and the unseen episode of the seen and the unseen posted by amit varma on july in this is the seventh installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india all around me the air is filled with the anguished groans of cricket purists england scored against australia a few days ago in a one day match at trent bridge despite a slowdown in which no boundaries were hit in the last four overs in their previous odi at the venue against pakistan they had made and it is not just this venue everywhere it would seem mishits are going for six record scores are being posted and bowlers are settling down in bathtubs to slash their wrists the purist lament is simple for a variety of reasons the balance between bat and ball has been upset heavier bats shorter boundaries bad regulations the malign influence of twenty cricket in the good old days my friends declaim in sophisticated accents cricket was not a spectacle but a contest also though they do not say this petrol was two rupees a litre as these notional nostalgics collapse at my feet i want not to console them but to whack them on their unhelmeted heads yes cricket has changed i want to tell them but it has changed for the better get over yourself go watch a game first up let us consider why the balance of the game has shifted towards run scoring heavier bats are just part of the reason the main cause is that batsmen have been forced to develop new skills because of the changed imperatives of t cricket having ten wickets in hand but only balls in an innings means that the value of a run goes up the value of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball is immense this mandates greater aggression batsmen have thus developed a wider array of skills than previous generations needed to consider ab devillier s degree game fielders are now better than ever in the past because each run saved is that much more important and bowlers have also adapted that old cliche of t cricket being a slugfest where you can replace bowlers with bowling machines is nonsense bowlers who once focussed on restricting runs have realised that the best way to keep the score down is to take wickets attack is the best defence modern spinners like rashid chahal kuldeep are not scared to flight the ball in search of wickets in contrast to the flat odi spin bowling of the past the top teams in this latest ipl were the ones who bowled to take wickets not to restrict consider how ms dhoni used his csk fast bowlers these skills have migrated to the other forms of the gameand have enriched them the writer gideon haigh once mentioned why he found the odi world cup fascinating you got test match quality bowlingbecause the only way to slow down batsmen these days is to get them outand t batting skills that illustrates how the game has evolved into a deeper more complex beastwhich is a good thing and yes in all this the balance between bat and ball has shifted but why was the older balancesay from the s when was a good score in a over odibetter in any way is it because that is the one we are used to and which forms our comfort zone and anchors our expectations here s a thought experiment if t cricket had been invented before test cricket and tests came later how would people have responded would we wonder what the point of five day cricket was without the challenging constraint of having a limited number of balls to score your runs in another thought experiment if someone introduced a five day baseball game or a nine hour football game how would people react to them would they immediately diss the shorter form beyond the skills argument there is also a pragmatic reason to celebrate t cricket few people even performative purists have five days to watch a game of cricket these days or even one whole day there are just too many other claimants for your time cricket was heading for commercial death when this new form came to the rescue long enough to pack in immense drama short enough to finish in an evening in future t s will end up subsidising test cricket and keeping it alive indeed i celebrate t cricket not because i like it more than test cricket they are different sports requiring different skills and i find it graceless when fans of one sport disparage another i celebrate it because t s have enhanced tests by bringing new skills and strategic learnings into the game and they will keep tests alive in commercial terms that is why every purist should celebrate twenty cricket posted by amit varma on june in this is the sixth installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india from the way this government behaves you would think that the people of india are a great danger a few days ago the government floated a tender asking for vendors who would build for it a comprehensive analytics system to monitor and analyse various aspects of social media communication and world wide web put simply a surveillance system that will track all your online activity and know everything about you so that you behave this tender came on the heels of an earlier proposal mooted by smriti irani then the i b minister to regulate online media these specific proposals were par for the course any government looks for ways to expand its power over its citizens as much as we should protest these attempts we should also consider that the real problem lies elsewhere the biggest danger to our democracy is not one set of people lusting for power but the mindset that all of us have the indian people still behave as if we are subjects of an empire we have no rights except those that our rulers are kind enough to grant us and they are our mai baap yes since the british left we have a procedure to elect our own rulers but we remain the ruled in a democratic republic the people should be in charge and the government should serve the only legitimate role of the state is to protect the rights of its citizens that is what laws are for and yet in this inversion of roles that we have accepted laws become the tool by which our rulers keep us in check the mere rule of law is never enough for this and the state always seeks to expand its power with that magic word regulation we accept and encourage this whenever we see a social or economic problem of any kind we assume that the solution must lie with government and demand regulation we need to reverse our thinking we should regulate the government and not the other way around you should always be suspicious of any sentence with the phrase government regulation most of the time when someone proposes any kind of government regulation it is something that will harm the common citizen help a special interest group and expand the power of an oppressive state let me explain first of all let us take for granted that the fundamental role of the state is to protect the rights of its citizens it has to maintain the rule of law in any marketplace whether of goods services or ideas this is all it needs to do punish cheats and thieves enforce contracts ensure that all interactions are voluntary and there is no coercion it needs to do no more than this now consider what happens when the government decides to regulate something in the public interest the state is not a benevolent godlike force that works in society s best interests politics is an interplay of power and money and those in power have always been captured by special interests there is already a power imbalance in favour of these special interests to grant the government more power is to increase that imbalance usually in any market competition is the best regulation a common form of government regulation is to increase entry barriers in a marketplace thus reducing competition this hurts the consumers or us common citizens it helps entrenched special interests this is as true of the marketplace of ideas as it is of the marketplace for goods and services social and online media are already subject to laws that fight criminal activityincluding many laws against free speech that should not exist further regulation is an attempt to protect one set of ideas and intimidate another this reduces the possibility of dissent this is bad for democracy the issue here is not which party happens to be in power at a given time whenever you concede a certain set of powers to a government imagine the worst possible person in charge it could be yogi adityanath or sonia gandhi or arvind kejriwalwhoever you dislike most the state should have so little power and such strong checks and balances that the worst person imaginable being in charge will not be a threat to the nation so the next time someone proposes government regulation of any kind with the most noble rhetoric behind it raise your voice it is the natural tendency of the state to try to grab as much power as possible it is the duty of the citizen to resist posted by amit varma on june in this is the fifth installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india i was when i first heard chris cornell sing and i still remember the shock of that moment the song was by a band called temple of the dog and the other vocalist on that song was eddie vedder cornell and vedder with soundgarden and pearl jam respectively would go on to become the iconic vocalists of their age unlike their grunge peers kurt cobain and layne staley they did not die young and actually built a strong body of work wait strike that cornell died last week at the age of and now that i too am on the wrong side of it feels like it was way too young this column is not a nostalgic musing of a middle aged man though instead it is sparked by something cornell s wife vicky said after he died he was not the type to commit suicide she said and his death was probably caused by an anti anxiety medicine he was taking called ativan the side effects of ativan include paranoid or suicidal thoughts slurred speech and impaired judgment when vicky spoke to chris over the phone after his last concert she said his speech was slurred that mildly tweaking the chemical balance of the brain could turn a person suicidal is not surprising anti depressants are so popular because we know you can turn the switch the other way indeed it drives home the fact that what we call our personality is actually deeply contingent it arises from the state of the brain you damage a tiny part of the brain or tweak its chemical or hormonal balance and voila you have a different person back in the day the brain was not considered as important as it should be bodies supposedly had souls inside them and people spoke of minds as if they were independent of the brain we now know that the former is bunkum and the latter at best a metaphor the most popular case study in neuroscience is probably that of phineas gage a th century american railroad worker when he was an iron rod went through his head and a large part of his left frontal lobe was destroyed miraculously he survived but did he survive as himself his memory and intelligence were not affected by his accident but his personality changed so much that his friends and family described him as no longer gage over the decades we have learnt that the physical structure of the brain determines personality for example sociopathy is not a behavioural defect but a biological one damage to the amygdala the part of the brain believed to cause feelings of empathy for others is the probable culprit four percent of us are born sociopaths though they are over represented among criminals bankers lawyers and politicians i am not joking neuroscientists have even identified parts of the brain that are responsible for spiritual feelings though i classified being devout as a mental disorder long before i knew this the physical structure of the brain is just the start of it tweaking the chemical or hormonal balance of the brain can also shape and change personality that accounts for the popularity of anti depressants and cognitive super drugs like modafinil which i take occasionally similarly a coffee or sugar high can change behaviour and hunger or lust can transform us most of these processes we are barely beginning to understand leave alone control but one day we will be able to shape a child s personality before its birth using genetic engineering the big point i am making here is that what we call our self is fragile and accidental all humans and their brains are more or less identical tiny differences in our physical brains and their chemical and hormonal balance account for who we are self help books teach us that we are all unique but the truth is that we are basically made of the same matter differ only in circumstance and that embracing this truth is the only route to a happiness that is not delusional i do not mean to imply here that nature is everything nurture is as important as steven pinker once wrote nature gives us knobs of varying sizes and nurture turns them that underlines even more the accidental nature of our identity we have the brains and bodies that we have and then we are born into the circumstances that we are it is all just luck so the next time you meet a hindutva nationalist who dreams of akhand bharat ask him if he would have felt the same way if he happened to be born in lahore and his parents named him anwar if the question makes him angry hand him an ativan but no in all seriousness empathise with that dude there but for the grace of luck stand you posted by amit varma on may in this is the fourth installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a century ago when india was still a british colony some of our most prominent freedom fighters were lawyers gandhi ambedkar nehru rajagopalachari mookerjee and patel among others it is fitting then that a few days ago it was a lawyer who made an eloquent plea for freedom against a government that is arguably as oppressive and certainly more powerful than the british were remember the name shyam divan divan was arguing against the government s recent decision to make aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns previous challenges to this act on the basis of the right to privacy were held up in court and divan could not make that argument for technical reasons instead he based his argument on a person s ownership of his own body my fingerprints and iris are my own he said as far as i am concerned the state cannot take away my body others cannot act in a way that subjects my body to their interests divan argued that the imposition of aadhaar completely takes away your political and personal choices you are a dog on an electronic leash tagged and tracked your progress hobbled a person s body divan pointed out could not be nationalised this is not a new argument divan cited both enlightenment and modern day philosophers during his masterful submission and john locke was among them it should be intuitive that all humans own their own bodies but it was locke in the th century who gave the first clear articulation of this every man has a property in his own person this no body has any right to but himself what does it mean to own yourself well there are three implications of this one for the right to self ownership to have any meaning you need to respect the corresponding right of others this leads to what libertarians call the non aggression principle you cannot initiate violence against another person two all legitimate rights flow from this right to self ownership the right to free speech for your thoughts are yours and you should be free to express them the right to property which is a result of your labours and of voluntary exchange the right to interact with any other consenting adult in any way you wish economic or personal that does not hurt anyone else three because a situation where every person has to fend for themselves is unviable and likely to be violent the state is a necessary evil it commits some violence on the people for taxes are violence but only to the minimum extent required to protect our rights note that these rights are not granted to us by the state as if they are favours instead we have these rights to begin with and we have brought the state into being to protect them the purpose of the constitution is to limit the power of the state and not to be in divan s words a charter of servitude here then are the two visions of the state the old one where the people are mere subjects ruled by the state for all practical purposes owned by the state the modern one in which the state is an instrument of the people tasked only with protecting their rights deep inside the belly of any modern state though is the old one waiting to spring forth governments consist of humans who are corrupted by power the state with its monopoly on violence has tons of power thus states tend to grow endlessly and become an ever present parasite on its people divan s argument was based on personal autonomy and consent and the attorney general of india mukul rohatgi was ready with a response indians do not have a right over their own bodies he said adding that there are various laws which put restrictions on such a right this made for a shocking headline but he was stating the obvious india is a country where you can go to jail for what you say or what you eat there are countless restrictions on markets which are basically networks of voluntary exchanges if two consenting adults can be put behind bars for engaging in an act that infringes on no one else s rights can they be said to own themselves there are laws against victimless crimes like gambling and alcohol and there is an arrogant condescension by the state towards common citizens as if it exists to rule us and not to serve us our constitution paid lip service to individual rights but did not do enough to safeguard them it will not save us and thus nor will the supreme court it is up to us to snap out of our apathy and declare as that battery of lawyers did a century ago that we will not be ruled any more that we own ourselves what is your view on this do you own your body posted by amit varma on may in this is the third installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india when the indian premier league began a decade ago my fellow cricket purists bemoaned what they called a tamasha version of the game i was baffled that so many people felt a three hour game was too short to be taken seriously as a sport football lasts minutes hockey is an hour tennis badminton basketball matches all tend to be shorter none of them lack nuance or complexity or drama and are rich in strategic and tactical options so why should t cricket be any less than that i expected t cricket to have a number of positive effects and it has delivered on all those counts it has widened the pool of players who can make a healthy living by being professional players it was broadened the audience for the game as many more people are willing to spend three hours watching the game than than they would be to spend five days and it has enriched the other forms of the game cricketers are now fitter than ever before and batsmen and bowlers alike have in their arsenal that were not necessary before the shorter format demands greater urgency and players have to approach the game differently intent leads to ability a batsman who needs to play an aggressive stroke to every ball will develop a better repertoire of aggressive strokes a fielder who is desperate to save every run he can will be fitter and will have better technique bowlers in turn will have to adapt to more aggressive batsmen by pushing the limits of what they can do and indeed contrary to early stereotypes t cricket is not a bang bang slog fest and bowlers remain matchwinners this has percolated down to test cricket nostalgia makes us overestimate the past but in terms of pure skill modern greats are a league above the legends of the past this is not because they are inherently more talented or hard working it is because as an economist would say the incentives are different t cricket demands more from them and they have adapted i consider t cricket to be a separate sport all on its own and in that light the last ten years have been fascinating we have seen a new sport evolve out of the framework of an old one and every year has seen the game develop rapidly the key strategic development has been in the structure of the game itself teams initially came to t with an approach transplanted from one day cricket every innings had three broad phases pinch hit consolidate slog but this was a mistake in odis teams have around seven batting resources for overs in t s they have the same number of batting resources for of the overs the reduced overs mean that of a dot ball goes up and the opportunity cost of a wicket goes down the risk reward ratio changes so batsmen should attack more in fact they should begin with attack and attack all the way through a team that bats through overs losing only three wickets has probably wasted resources given the batsmen waiting in the pavilion they should have attacked more every over can be a slog over some teams understood this like west indies in the last t world cup or sunrisers hyderabad last year but many teams still do not get it i wrote before last year s ipl that teams are underestimating par scores and not frontloading so anyone into cricket betting should blindly bet on the team batting second as the team batting first will score less than optimally that is exactly what happened out of the first games were won by the side chasing in an average of overs with an average wickets in hand teams adjusted in the second half so follow that advice this year only for teams that do not frontload the most important statistic for a batsman thus is his strike rate we might consider a strike rate of healthy by odi standards but it is pathetic for t s a team batting at that strike rate would make runs which is well below par a batsman playing at that strike rate is thus a liability to his team the more balls he faces the more he is letting them down as there should be no consolidation or innings building phase in t s there is no ameliorating factor over a season so here s one stat you should keep your eye on this season a batsman s season long strike rate minus the overall par score strike rate for a par score of that would be let us call it the varma number if it is negative the batsman has failed earlier pieces by me on this subject posted by amit varma on april in this is the second installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india there comes a moment in some lives when a sudden unexpected event makes you look at the world with greater clarity than before it could be a happy moment a childhood friend proposes to you or you stumble into parenthood it could be a sad one you are diagnosed with cancer and told you have six months to live it makes you look at the world differently and some things seem so clear that you wonder why you did not notice them before in the life of our nation the rise of yogi adityanath to the chief ministership of uttar pradesh might well be one such unexpected yet clarifying moment i was stunned when it was announced and yet it makes so much sense that any counterfactual now seems absurd it was i have come to believe a decisive and inevitable event in a conflict that has been simmering in india for at least a century the great battle that took place on our peninsula was not between the natives and our colonial overlords but between a new way of thinking and an old way of existing while the enlightenment swept its way across europe and the usa in the th century its influence was felt in india only in the th liberalism however one tries to spin it was an import from the west and it is ironic that many of our finest freedom fighters were influenced by british thinkers the great early figures of our resistance heroes of mine such as naoroji ranade agarkar and gokhale were essentially british liberals until mahatma gandhi the freedom struggle was a battle between the british empire on one hand and indian elites inspired by western ideas on the other gandhi did catalyse it into a mass movement but his intellectual influences were not indian either he was more influenced by ruskin and tolstoy than any indian thinker and vs naipaul once called him the least indian of indian leaders by the time the british finally quit india the liberalism of the gokhale years had been replaced by the soft socialism that was then in vogue do note that both these strains the early classical liberalism and the socialism that is so antithetical to it were western imports the constitution intended as an operating manual for this new nation reflected this the commentator nitin pai in a magazine i edit wrote on th january the enlightenment was injected into the veins of indian society in the form of a written statute we are still dealing with the shock of that moment into the veins of indian society it is worth reflecting here that the state and society are two different beasts this difference is a cornerstone of conservatism which the encyclopaedia britannica as a political doctrine that emphasizes the value of traditional institutions and practices who were the indian conservatives who would lead the fightback of society against the state the biggest manifestation of conservatism in india is what we call the hindutva right i used to be sceptical of it as i consider hindutva to be an artificial construct an insulting caricature of a great inclusive religion but even if that is so hindutva is authentically conservative because it arises out of a nativism that is inherent in human nature and consequently rooted in our culture culture can both mitigate and reinforce human nature which is the whole struggle right there early indian conservatives were more interested in social rather than political battles which is why they did not play much of a role in the freedom movement after independence the nehruvian big state seemed to have subdued the hindutva social project but this was temporary the journalist rishi majumder who is writing a biography of the conservative leader syama prasad mookerjee describes in a forthcoming essay in pragati how the rss as well as other right wing groups organizations and movements have thrived and grown through many years when the bjp was not in power much modern politics is the battle between these competing visions of the state should the state be a superstructure that imposes certain values decided upon by elites upon society or should it be a servant to society protecting its traditions without judging them from the prism of other value systems narendra modi s rise to power was fascinating because he embodied the hopes of people on both sides of that spectrum some classical liberals dismayed by nehruvian socialism backed him because they saw the damage nehru s ideas had done to india and wanted their values imposed from above and the whole hindutva movement obviously fell in behind modi because his ascent was the culmination of their century long struggle these two strands are incompatible and now with the rise of yogi adityanath there is no more ambiguity posted by amit varma on march in this piece was published under a different headline in the sunday times of india today it marks the start of a column for them called the rationalist the other day an internet troll sent me a love letter why have you blocked me on twitter he demanded to know you claim to believe in the freedom of expression you are a hypocrite after that he said a few colourful things about my family i think he wanted me to copulate with them i am an absolutist when it comes to free speech and this friendly troll was wrong indeed i find that there is no concept as deeply misunderstood today as the right to free speech these misunderstandings exist on all sides of the political spectrum thus i find myself duty bound to write this brief primer on the philosophical origins of free speech to illustrate what i understand it to be the earliest conception of individual rights came from the th century enlightenment philosopher locke held that the most fundamental right of all the one from which all others emerged was the right to self ownership after all it is practically self evident and beyond argument that right from birth all of us own ourselves all individual rights arise out of this right to self ownership the right to life the right to our thoughts and thus to our speech the right to our actions which also results in the right to property and so on freedom another misunderstood term means a condition in which these rights are not infringed all of our rights are contingent to our respecting the corresponding rights and thus freedom of others my fist stops where your nose begins as that old saying goes libertarians also call this the where aggression is defined as infringing someone s rights you may do anything as long as there is no coercion involved by this reckoning all voluntary interactions between consenting adults are kosher as long as they do not infringe on anyone else s rights this holds true as i often point out whether those interactions happen in the marketplace or in the bedroom both the left and the right are thus incoherent when they support one kind of voluntary exchange but not the other in accordance with the non aggression principle the core question i ask myself in any situation is where is the coercion looked at this way many of the questions that keep getting raised about free speech answer themselves am i infringing on the rights of the troll i block no because there is no coercion involved he is still free to say whatever he wants but he is not entitled to my time and attention is a college within its rights to withdraw an invitation to a speaker yes it is their property and the speaker can still express himself elsewhere if people have a right to free speech though it does not mean that all free speech is right virender sehwag had a right to mock gurmehar kaur for earlier this week just as i have a right to find his mockery tasteless and my friendly troll has a right to call me names for it we all have a right to be wrong including the trolls who try to have a chilling effect on free speech with their constant abuse the truth is only the government can shut down free speech and even trolls have a right to abuse do note that twitter would also be within its rights to ban trolls who are using their property after agreeing to certain terms of use when it comes to our actions there is much that we can do that can harm others but it is very hard to breach the non aggression principle with words alone as that old adage goes sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me recognising this the first amendment of the us constitution protects free speech in absolute terms obviously words can be used to incite physical violence and that is a reasonable limit of free speech the us supreme court in a famous case brandeburg vs ohio set the standard as imminent lawless action the indian constitution sadly does not protect free speech article lays out caveats such as public order and decency and morality which are open to misinterpretation and thus misuse this is a pity but our democracy is a work in progress and is made healthier by a free exchange of ideas for that reason i was alarmed when i read about free speech being subordinate to the needs of the sovereign state that is the wrong way around and i would argue that a healthy nation needs an open exchange of ideas for which free speech is indispensable that is why if i were asked to compare arun jaitley and umar khalid i would say that it is jaitley who is anti national and a threat to our great republic posted by amit varma on march in ',\n",

nothing new just another round on the treadmill although i would remember her fondly i thought me and cricket were done and then i fell in love again cricket has changed in the last few years in glorious ways there have been new ways of thinking about the game there have been new ways of playing the game every season new kinds of drama form new nuances spring up into sight this is true even of what had once seemed the dullest form of the game one day cricket we are entering into a brave new world and the team leading us there is england no matter what happens in the world cup final today a single game involves a huge amount of luck this england side are extraordinary they are the bridge between eras leading us into a golden age of cricket i know that sounds hyperbolic so let me stun you further by saying that i give the ipl credit for this and now having woken up you up with such a jolt on this lovely sunday morning let me explain twenty cricket changed the game in two fundamental ways both ended up changing one day cricket the first was strategy when the first t games took place teams applied an odi template to innings building pinch hit build slog but this was not an optimal approach in odis teams have players over overs in t s they have players over overs the equation between resources and constraints is different this means that the cost of a wicket goes down and the cost of a dot ball goes up critically it means that the value of aggression rises a team need not follow the odi template in some instances attacking for all overs or as i call it frontloading may be optimal west indies won the t world cup in by doing just this and england played similarly and some sides began to realise was that they had been underestimating the value of aggression in one day cricket as well the second fundamental way in which t cricket changed cricket was in terms of skills the ipl and other leagues brought big money into the game this changed incentives for budding cricketers relatively few people break into test or odi cricket and play for their countries a much wider pool can aspire to play t cricket which also provides much more money so it makes sense to spend the hundreds of hours you are in the nets honing t skills rather than test match skills go to any nets practice and you will find many more kids practising innovative aggressive strokes than playing the forward defensive as a result batsmen today have a wider array of attacking strokes than earlier generations because every run counts more in t cricket the standard of fielding has also shot up and bowlers have also reacted to this by expanding their arsenal of tricks everyone has had to lift their game in one day cricket thus two things have happened one there is better strategic understanding about the value of aggression two batsmen are better equipped to act on the aggressive imperative the game has continued to evolve bowlers have reacted to this with greater aggression on their part and this ongoing dialogue has been fascinating the cricket writer gideon haigh once told me on my podcast that the world cup featured a battle between t batting and test match bowling this england team is the high watermark so far their aggression does not come from slogging they bat with a combination of intent and skills that allows them to coast at an over without needing to take too many risks in normal conditions thus they can coast to any hitting they do beyond that is the bonus that takes them to or it is a whole new level illustrated by the fact that at one point a few days ago they had seven consecutive scores of to their name look at their scores over the last few years in fact and it is clear that this is the greatest batting side in the history of one day cricket by a margin there have been stumbles in this world cup but in the bigger picture those are outliers if england have a bad day in the final and new zealand play their a game england might even lose today but if captain morgan s men play their a game they will coast to victory new zealand does not have those gears no other team in the world does for now but one day they will all have to learn to play

spend the hundreds of hours you are in the nets honing t skills rather than test match skills go to any nets practice and you will find many more kids practising innovative aggressive strokes than playing the forward defensive as a result batsmen today have a wider array of attacking strokes than earlier generations because every run counts more in t cricket the standard of fielding has also shot up and bowlers have also reacted to this by expanding their arsenal of tricks everyone has had to lift their game in one day cricket thus two things have happened one there is better strategic understanding about the value of aggression two batsmen are better equipped to act on the aggressive imperative the game has continued to evolve bowlers have reacted to this with greater aggression on their part and this ongoing dialogue has been fascinating the cricket writer gideon haigh once told me on my podcast that the world cup featured a battle between t batting and test match bowling this england team is the high watermark so far their aggression does not come from slogging they bat with a combination of intent and skills that allows them to coast at an over without needing to take too many risks in normal conditions thus they can coast to any hitting they do beyond that is the bonus that takes them to or it is a whole new level illustrated by the fact that at one point a few days ago they had seven consecutive scores of to their name look at their scores over the last few years in fact and it is clear that this is the greatest batting side in the history of one day cricket by a margin there have been stumbles in this world cup but in the bigger picture those are outliers if england have a bad day in the final and new zealand play their a game england might even lose today but if captain morgan s men play their a game they will coast to victory new zealand does not have those gears no other team in the world does for now but one day they will all have to learn to play like this posted by amit varma on july in essays and op eds sport the rationalist this is the rd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india i had a strange dream last night i dreamt that the government had passed a law that made using laptops illegal i would have to write this column by hand i would also have to leave my home in mumbai to deliver it in person to my editor in delhi i woke up trembling and angry and realised how indian farmers feel every single day of their lives my column today is a tale of two satyagrahas both involve farmers technology and the freedom of choice one of them began this month but first let us go back to the turn of the millennium as the s came to an end cotton farmers across india were in distress pests known as bollworms were ravaging crops across the country farmers had to use increasing amounts of pesticide to keep them at bay the costs of the pesticide and the amount of labour involved made it unviable and often the crops would fail anyway then technology came to the rescue the farmers heard of bt cotton a genetically modified type of cotton that kept these pests away and was being used around the world but they were illegal in india even though no bad effects had ever been recorded well who cares about illegal when it is a matter of life and death farmers in gujarat got hold of bt cotton seeds from the black market and planted them you will never guess what happened next as began all cotton crops in gujarat failed except the hectares that had bt cotton the government did not care about the failed crops they cared about the illegal ones they ordered all the bt cotton crops to be destroyed it was time for a satyagraha and not just in gujarat the late sharad joshi leader of the shetkari sanghatana in maharashtra took around farmers to gujarat to stand with their fellows there they sat in the fields of bt cotton and basically said over our dead bodies joshi s point was simple all other citizens of india have access to the latest technology from all over they are all empowered with choice why should farmers be held back the satyagraha was successful the ban on bt cotton was lifted there are three things i would like to point out here one the lifting of the ban transformed cotton farming in india over of indian farmers now use bt cotton india has become the world s largest producer of cotton moving ahead of china according to agriculture expert ashok gulati india has gained us billion in the years since from higher exports and import savings because of bt cotton most importantly cotton farmers incomes have doubled two gmo crops have become standard across the world around million hectares of gmo crops have been planted worldwide and gmo foods are accepted in countries the humanitarian benefits have been massive golden rice a variety of rice packed with minerals and vitamins has prevented blindness in countless new born kids since it was introduced in the philippines three despite the fear mongering of some ngos whose existence depends on alarmism the science behind gmo is settled no harmful side effects have been noted in all these years and millions of lives impacted positively a couple of years ago over nobel laureates signed a petition asserting that gmo foods were safe and blasting anti science ngos that stood in the way of progress there is scientific consensus on this the science may be settled but the politics is not the government still bans some types of gmo seeds such as bt brinjal which was developed by an indian company called mahyco and used successfully in bangladesh more crucially a variety called ht bt cotton which fights weeds is also banned weeding takes up to of a farmer s time and often makes farming unviable farmers across the world use this variant of global cotton crops are ht bt indian farmers are so desperate for it that they choose to break the law and buy expensive seeds from the black market but the government is cracking down a farmer in haryana had his crop destroyed by the government in may on june this year a farmer named lalit bahale in the akola district of maharashtra kicked off a satyagraha by planting banned seeds of ht bt cotton and bt brinjal he was soon joined by thousands of farmers far from our urban eyes a heroic fight has begun our farmers already victimised and oppressed by a predatory government in countless ways are fighting for their right to take charge of their lives as this brave struggle unfolds i am left with a troubling question all those satyagrahas of the past by our great freedom fighters what were they for if all they got us was independence and not freedom posted by amit varma on june in this is the nd installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india trade wars are on the rise and it is enough to get any nationalist all het up and excited earlier this week narendra modi s government that it would start imposing tariffs on us products starting today this is a response to similar treatment towards us from the us there is one thing i would invite you to consider trump and modi are not engaged in a war with each other instead they are waging war on their own people let us unpack that a bit part of the reason trump came to power is that he provided simple and wrong answers for people s problems he responded to the growing jobs crisis in middle america with two explanations one foreigners are coming and taking your jobs two your jobs are being shipped overseas both explanations are wrong but intuitive and they worked for trump he is stupid enough that he probably did not create these narratives for votes but actually believes them the first of those leads to the demonising of immigrants the second leads to a demonising of trade trump has acted on his rhetoric after becoming president and a modern us version of our old indira is india slogan might well be trump is tariff tariff is trump contrary to the fulminations of the economically illiterate all tariffs are bad without exception let me illustrate this with an example say there is a fictional product called brump a local brump costs rs foreign manufacturers appear and offer better brumps at a cheaper price say rs consumers shift to foreign brumps manufacturers of local brumps get angry and form an interest group they lobby the government or bribe it with campaign contributions to impose a tariff on import of brumps the government puts a rupee tariff the foreign brumps now cost rs and people start buying local brumps again this is a good thing right local businesses have been helped and local jobs have been saved but this is only the seen effect the unseen effect of this tariff is that millions of brump buyers would have saved rs per brump if there were no tariffs this money would have gone out into the economy been part of new demand generated more jobs everyone would have been better off and the overall standard of living would have been higher that brings to me to an essential truth about tariffs every tariff is a tax on your own people and every intervention in markets amounts to a distribution of wealth from the people at large to specific interest groups in other words from the poor to the rich the costs of this are dispersed and invisible what is rs to any of us and the benefits are large and worth fighting for local manufacturers of brumps can make crores extra much modern politics amounts to manufacturers of brumps buying politicians to redistribute money from us to them there are second order effects of protectionism as well when the us imposes tariffs on other countries those countries may respond by imposing tariffs back raw materials for many goods made locally are imported and as these become expensive so do those goods that quintessential american product the iphone uses parts from countries as local products rise in price because of expensive foreign parts prices rise demand goes down jobs are lost and everyone is worse off trump keeps talking about how he wants to win at trade but trade is not a zero sum game the most misunderstood term in our times is probably trade deficit a country has a trade deficit when it imports more than what it exports and trump thinks of that as a bad thing it is not i run a trade deficit with my domestic help and my local grocery store i buy more from them than they do from me that is fine because we all benefit it is a win win game similarly trade between countries is really trade between the people of both countries and people trade with each other because they are both better off to interfere in that process is to reduce the value created in their lives it is immoral to modify a slogan often identified with libertarians like me tariffs are theft these trade wars thus carry a touch of the absurd any leader who imposes tariffs is imposing a tax on his own people just see the chain of events trump taxes the american people in retaliation modi taxes the indian people trump raises taxes modi raises taxes nationalists in both countries cheer interests groups in both countries laugh their way to the bank what kind of idiocy is this how long will this lose lose game continue posted by amit varma on june in this is the st installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india when all political parties agree on something you know you might have a problem giriraj singh a minister in narendra modi s new cabinet that our population control law should become a movement this is something that would find bipartisan support we are taught from school onwards that india s population is a big problem and we need to control it this is wrong contrary to popular belief our population is not a problem it is our greatest strength the notion that we should worry about a growing population is an intuitive one the world has limited resources people keep increasing something s gotta give robert malthus made just this point in his book an essay on the principle of population he was worried that our population would grow exponentially while resources would grow arithmetically as more people entered the workforce wages would fall and goods would become scarce calamity was inevitable malthus s rationale was so influential that this mode of thinking was soon called malthusian it is a pejorative today a th century follower of his harrison brown came up with one of my favourite images on this subject arguing that a growing population would lead to the earth being covered completely and to a considerable depth with a writhing mass of human beings much as a dead cow is covered with a pulsating mass of maggots another malthusian paul ehrlich published a book called the population bomb in which began with the stirring lines the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now ehrlich was as you would guess a big supporter of india s coercive family planning programs i do not see he wrote how india could possibly feed two hundred million more people by none of these fears have come true a study by nicholas eberstadt called found no correlation between population density and poverty the greater the density of people the more you would expect them to fight for resources and yet monaco which has times the population density of bangladesh is doing well for itself so is bahrain which has three times the population density of india not only does population not cause poverty it makes us more prosperous the economist julian simon pointed out in a book that through history whenever there has been a spurt in population it has coincided with a spurt in productivity such as for example between malthus s time and now there were around a billion people on earth in and there are around billion today as you read these words consider that you are better off than the richest person on the planet then why is this the answer lies in the title of simon s book the ultimate resource when we speak of resources we forget that human beings are the finest resource of all there is no limit to our ingenuity and we interact with each other in positive sum ways every voluntary interactions leaves both people better off and the amount of value in the world goes up this is why we want to be part of economic networks that are as large and as dense as possible this is why most people migrate to cities rather than away from them and why cities are so much richer than towns or villages if malthusians were right essential commodities like wheat maize and rice would become relatively scarcer over time and thus more expensive but they have actually become much cheaper in real terms this is thanks to the productivity and creativity of humans who in eberstadt s words are in practice always renewable and in theory entirely inexhaustible the error made by malthus brown and ehrlich is the same error that our politicians make today and not just in the context of population zero sum thinking if our population grows and resources stays the same of course there will be scarcity but this is never the case all we need to do to learn this lesson is look at our cities this mistaken thinking has had savage humanitarian consequences in india think of the unborn millions over the decades because of our brutal family planning policies how many tendulkars rahmans and satyajit rays have we lost think of the immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country and finally think of the condescension of our politicians asserting that people are india s problem but always other people never themselves this arrogance is india s greatest problem not our people posted by amit varma on june in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india amit shah s induction into the union cabinet is such an interesting moment even partisans who oppose the bjp as i do would admit that shah is a political genius under his leadership the bjp has become an electoral behemoth in the most complicated political landscape in the world the big question that now arises is this can shah do for india what he did for the bjp this raises a perplexing question in the last five years as the bjp has flourished india has languished and yet the leadership of both the party and the nation are more or less the same then why has not the ability to manage the party translated to governing the country i would argue that there are two reasons for this one the skills required in those two tasks are different two so are the incentives in play let us look at the skills first managing a party like the bjp is in some ways like managing a large multinational company shah is a master at top down planning and micro management the elections described in detail in prashant jha s book how the bjp wins should be a harvard business school case study the book describes how he fixed the bjp s ground game in uttar pradesh picking teams for booths in uttar pradesh monitoring them and keeping them accountable shah looked at the market segmentation in up and hit upon his now famous formula he realised he could not deliver the votes of muslims yadavs and jatavs who were of the population so he focussed on wooing the other including non yadav obcs and non jatav dalits he carried out versions of these caste reconfigurations across states and according to jha covered over lakh kilometres between and consolidating market share in every state in this country he nurtured a pool of a thousand new obc and dalit leaders going well beyond the posturing of other parties that so many dalits and obcs voted for the bjp in is astonishing shah went past mandal politics managing to subsume previously antagonistic castes and sub castes into a broad hindutva identity and as the bjp increased its depth it expanded its breadth as well what it has done in west bengal wiping out the left and weakening mamata banerjee is jaw dropping with hindsight it may one day seem inevitable but only a madman could have conceived it and only a genius could have executed it good man to be home minister then eh not quite a country is not like a large company or even a political party it is much too complex to be managed from the top down and a control freak is bound to flounder the approach needed is very different some tasks of governance it is true are tailor made for efficient managers building infrastructure taking care of roads and power building toilets even without an underlying drainage system and pr campaigns can all be executed by good managers but the deeper tasks of making an economy flourish require a different approach they need a light touch not a heavy hand the th century is full of cautionary tales that show that economies cannot be centrally planned from the top down examples of that fatal conceit to use my hero friedrich hayek s term include the soviet union mao s china and even the lady modi most reminds me of indira gandhi the task of the state when it comes to the economy is to administer a strong rule of law and to make sure it is applied equally no special favours to cronies or special interest groups just unleash the natural creativity of the people and do not try to micro manage sadly the bjp s impulse like that of most governments of the past is a statist one india should have a small state that does a few things well instead we have a large state that does many things badly and acts as a parasite on its people as it happens the few things that we should do well are all right up shah s managerial alley for example the rule of law is effectively absent in india today especially for the poor as home minister shah could fix this if he applied the same zeal to governing india as he did to growing the bjp but will he and here we come to the question of incentives what drives amit shah maximising power or serving the nation what is good for the country will often coincide with what is good for the party but not always when they diverge which path will shah choose so much rests on that posted by amit varma on june in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india a friend of mine was very impressed by the interview narendra modi granted last week to akshay kumar such a charming man such great work ethic he gushed he is the kind of uncle i would want my kids to have and then in the same breath he asked how can such a good man be such a bad prime minister i do not want to be uncharitable and suggest that modi s image is entirely manufactured so let us take the interview at face value let us also grant modi his claims about the purity of his neeyat intentions and reframe the question this way when it comes to public policy why do good intentions often lead to bad outcomes to attempt an answer i will refer to a story a friend of mine who knows modi well once told me about him modi was chilling with his friends at home more than a decade ago and told them an incident from his childhood his mother was ill once and the young narendra was tending to her the heat was enervating so the boy went to the switchboard to switch on the fan but there was no electricity my friend said that as he told this story modi s eyes filled with tears even after all these years he was moved by the memory my friend used this story to make the point that modi s vision of the world is experiential if he experiences something he understands it when he became chief minister of gujarat he made it his stated mission to get reliable electricity to every part of gujarat no doubt this was shaped by the time he flicked a switch as a young boy and the fan did not budge similarly he has given importance to things like roads and cleanliness since he would have experienced the impact of those as a young man my term for him inspired by rajat kapoor s film is the ankhon dekhi prime minister at one level this is a good thing he sees a problem and works for the rest of his life to solve it but what of things he cannot experience the economy is a complex beast as is society itself and beyond a certain level you need to grasp abstract concepts to understand how the world works you cannot experience them for example spontaneous order or the idea that society and markets like language cannot be centrally directed or planned or the positive sum nature of things which is the engine of our prosperity the idea that every transaction is a win win game and that for one person to win another does not have to lose or indeed respect for individual rights and free speech one understands abstract concepts by reading about them understanding them applying them to the real world modi is not known to be a reader and this is not his fault given his background it is a near miracle that he has made it this far he was not born into a home with a reading culture and did not have either the resources or the time when he was young to devote to reading the only way he could learn about the world thus was by experiencing it there are two lessons here one for modi himself and others in his position and another for everyone the lesson in this for modi is a lesson for anyone who rises to such an important position even if he is the smartest person in the world that lesson is to have humility about the bounds of your knowledge and to surround yourself with experts who can advise you well be driven by values and not confidence in your own knowledge gather intellectual giants around you and stand on their shoulders modi did not do this in the case of demonetisation which he carried out against the advice of every expert he consulted we all know the damage it caused to the economy the other learning from this is for all of us how do we make sense of the world by connecting dots an ankhon dekhi approach will get us very few dots and our view of the world will be blurred and incomplete the best way to gather more dots is reading the more we read the better we understand the world and the better the decisions we take when we can experience a thousand lives through books why restrict ourselves to one a good man with noble intentions can make bad decisions with horrible consequences the only way to hedge against this is by staying humble and reading more so when you finish reading this piece think of an unread book that you would like to read today and read it posted by amit varma on may in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india the man who gave us our national anthem rabindranath tagore once wrote that nationalism was a great menace he went on to say it is the particular thing which for years has been at the bottom of india s troubles not just india s but the world s in his book the open society and its enemies published in as adolf hitler was defeated karl popper ripped into nationalism with all its appeals to our tribal instincts to passion and to prejudice and to our nostalgic desire to be relieved from the strain of individual responsibility which it attempts to replace by a collective or group responsibility nationalism is resurgent today stomping across the globe hand in hand with populism in india too it is tearing us apart but must nationalism always be a bad thing a provocative new book by the israeli thinker yael tamir argues otherwise in her book why nationalism tamir makes the following arguments one nation states are here to stay two the state needs the nation to be viable three people need nationalism for the sense of community and belonging it gives them four therefore we need to build a better nationalism which brings people together instead of driving them apart the first point needs no elaboration we are a globalised world but we are also trapped by geography and circumstance only percent of the world s population tamir points out lives outside their country of birth nutopia the borderless state dreamed up by john lennon and yoko ono is not happening anytime soon if the only thing that citizens of a state have in common is geographical circumstance it is not enough if the state is a necessary construct a nation is its necessary justification political institutions crave to form long term political bonding writes tamir and for that matter they must create a community that is neither momentary nor meaningless nationalism she says endows the state with intimate feelings linking the past the present and the future more pertinently tamir argues people need nationalism i am a humanist with a belief in individual rights but tamir says that this is not enough the term human is a far too thin mode of delineation she writes individuals need to rely on thick identities to make their lives meaningful this involves a shared past a common culture and distinctive values tamir also points out that there is a strong correlation between social class and political preferences the privileged elites can afford to be globalists but those less well off are inevitably drawn to other narratives that enrich their lives rather than seeing nationalism as the last refuge of the scoundrel writes tamir we should start thinking of nationalism as the last hope of the needy tamir s book bases its arguments on the west but the argument holds in india as well in a country with so much poverty is it any wonder that nationalism is on the rise the cosmopolitan globe trotting elites do not have daily realities to escape but how are those less fortunate to find meaning in their lives i have one question though why is our nationalism so exclusionary when our nation is so inclusive in the nationalism that our ruling party promotes there are some communities who belong here and others who do not and even among those who belong they exploit divisions in their us vs them vision of the world some religions are foreign some values are foreign even some culinary traditions are foreign and therefore frowned upon but the india i know and love is just the opposite of that we embrace influences from all over our language our food our clothes our music our cinema have absorbed so many diverse influences that to pretend they come from a single legit source is absurd even the elegant churidar kurtas our prime minister wears have an islamic origin as an example take the recent film gully boy its style of music the clothes its protagonists wear even the attitudes in the film would have seemed alien to us a few decades ago and yet could there be a truer portrait of young india this inclusiveness this joyous khichdi that we are is what makes our nation a model for the rest of the world no nation embraces all other nations as ours does my india celebrates differences and i do as well i wear my kurta with jeans i listen to ghazals i eat dhansak and kababs and i dream in the indian language called english this is my nationalism those who try to divide us therefore are the true anti nationals we must reclaim nationalism from them posted by amit varma on april in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india one of my favourite english words comes from chess if it is your turn to move but any move you make makes your position worse you are in zugzwang narendra modi was in zugzwang after the pulwama attacks a few days agoas any indian prime minister in his place would have been an indian pm after an attack for which pakistan is held responsible has only unsavoury choices in front of him he is pulled in two opposite directions one strategy dictates that he must not escalate two politics dictates that he must let us unpack that first consider the strategic imperatives ever since both india and pakistan became nuclear powers a conventional war has become next to impossible because of the threat of a nuclear war if india escalates beyond a point pakistan might bring their nuclear weapons into play even a limited nuclear war could cause millions of casualties and devastate our economy thus no matter what the provocation india needs to calibrate its response so that the pakistan does not take it all the way it is impossible to predict what actions pakistan might view as sufficient provocation so india has tended to play it safe do not capture territory do not attack military assets do not kill civilians in other words surgical strikes on alleged terrorist camps is the most we can do given that pakistan knows that it is irrational for india to react and our leaders tend to be rational they can bleed us with a thousand cuts as their doctrine states with impunity both in when our parliament was attacked and the bjp s atal bihari vajpayee was pm and in when mumbai was attacked and the congress s manmohan singh was pm our leaders considered all the options on the tablebut were forced to do nothing but is doing nothing an option in an election year leave strategy aside and turn to politics india has been attacked forty soldiers have been killed and the nation is traumatised and baying for blood it is now politically impossible to not retaliateespecially for a pm who has criticized his predecessor for being weak and portrayed himself as a inch chested man of action i have no doubt that modi is a rational man and knows the possible consequences of escalation but he also knows the possible consequences of not escalatinghe could dilute his brand and lose the elections thus he is forced to act and after he acts his pakistan counterpart will face the same domestic pressure to retaliate and will have to attack back and so on till my home in versova is swallowed up by a nuclear crater right well not exactly there is a way to resolve this paradox india and pakistan can both escalate not via military actions but via optics modi and imran khan who you would expect to feel like the loneliest men on earth right now can find sweet company in each other their incentives are aligned neither man wants this to turn into a full fledged war both men want to appear macho in front of their domestic constituencies both men are masters at building narratives and have a pliant media that will help them thus india can carry out a surgical strike and claim it destroyed a camp killed terrorists and forced pakistan to return a braveheart prisoner of war pakistan can say india merely destroyed two trees plus a rock and claim the high moral ground by returning the prisoner after giving him good masala tea a benign military equilibrium is maintained and both men come out looking like strong leaders a win win game for the pms that avoids a lose lose game for their nations they can give themselves a high five in private when they meet next and imran can whisper to modi you are a good spinner bro there is one problem here though what if the optics do not work if modi feels that his public is too sceptical and he needs to do more he might feel forced to resort to actual military escalation the fog of politics might obscure the possible consequences if the resultant indian military action causes serious damage pakistan will have to respond in kind in the chain of events that then begins with body bags piling up neither man may be able to back down they could end up as prisoners of circumstanceand so could we also check out amit varma episode of the seen and the unseen episode of the seen and the unseen posted by amit varma on march in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india steven pinker in his book enlightenment now relates an old russian joke about two peasants named boris and igor they are both poor boris has a goat igor does not one day igor is granted a wish by a visiting fairy what will he wish for i wish he says that boris s goat should die the joke ends there revealing as much about human nature as about economics consider the three things that happen if the fairy grants the wish one boris becomes poorer two igor stays poor three inequality reduces is any of them a good outcome i feel exasperated when i hear intellectuals and columnists talking about economic inequality it is my contention that india s problem is poverty and that poverty and inequality are two very different things that often do not coincide to illustrate this i sometimes ask this question in which of the following countries would you rather be poor usa or bangladesh the obvious answer is usa where the poor are much better off than the poor of bangladesh and yet while bangladesh has greater poverty the usa has higher inequality indeed take a look at the countries of the world measured by the gini index which is that standard metric used to measure inequality and you will find that usa hong kong singapore and the united kingdom all have greater inequality than bangladesh liberia pakistan and sierra leone which are much poorer and yet while the poor of bangladesh would love to migrate to unequal usa i do not hear of too many people wishing to go in the opposite direction indeed people vote with their feet when it comes to choosing between poverty and inequality all of human history is a story of migration from rural areas to cities which have greater inequality if poverty and inequality are so different why do people conflate the two a key reason is that we tend to think of the world in zero sum ways for someone to win someone else must lose if the rich get richer the poor must be getting poorer and the presence of poverty must be proof of inequality but that is not how the world works the pie is not fixed economic growth is a positive sum game and leads to an expansion of the pie and everybody benefits in absolute terms the rich get richer and so do the poor often enough to come out of poverty and so in any growing economy as poverty reduces inequality tends to increase this is counter intuitive i know so used are we to zero sum thinking this is exactly what has happened in india since we liberalised parts of our economy in most people who complain about inequality in india are using the wrong word and are really worried about poverty put a millionaire in a room with a billionaire and no one will complain about the inequality in that room but put a starving beggar in there and the situation is morally objectionable it is the poverty that makes it a problem not the inequality you might think that this is just semantics but words matter poverty and inequality are different phenomena with opposite solutions you can solve for inequality by making everyone equally poor or you could solve for it by redistributing from the rich to the poor as if the pie was fixed the problem with this as any economist will tell you is that there is a trade off between redistribution and growth all redistribution comes at the cost of growing the pie and only growth can solve the problem of poverty in a country like ours it has been estimated that in india for every one percent rise in gdp two million people come out of poverty that is a stunning statistic when millions of indians do not have enough money to eat properly or sleep with a roof over their heads it is our moral imperative to help them rise out of poverty the policies that will make this possible allowing free markets incentivising investment and job creation removing state oppression are likely to lead to greater inequality so what it is more urgent to make sure that every indian has enough to fulfil his basic needs what the philosopher harry frankfurt in his fine book on inequality called the doctrine of sufficiency the elite in their airconditioned drawing rooms and those who live in rich countries can follow the fashions of the west and talk compassionately about inequality india does not have that luxury posted by amit varma on february in this is the th installment of the rationalist my column for the times of india it is election season and promises are raining down on voters like rose petals on naive newlyweds earlier this week the congress party announced a minimum income guarantee for the poor this friday the modi government released a budget full of sops as the days go by the promises will get bolder and you might feel important that so much attention is being given to you well the joke is on you every election hl mencken once said is an advance auction sale of stolen goods a bunch of competing mafias fight to rule over you for the next five years you decide who wins on the basis of who can bribe you better with your own money this is an absurd situation which i tried to express in a couple of years ago politics a neta who loves currency notes told me what his line of work denotes it is kind of funny we steal people s money and use some of it to buy their votes we are the dupes here and we pay far more to keep this circus going than this circus costs it would be okay if the parties once they came to power provided good governance but voters have given up on that and now only want patronage and handouts that leads to one of the biggest problems in indian politics we are stuck in an equilibrium where all good politics is bad economics and vice versa for example the minimum guarantee for the poor is good politics because the optics are great it is basically garibi hatao that slogan made indira gandhi a political juggernaut in the s at the same time that she unleashed a series of economic policies that kept millions of people in garibi for decades longer than they should have been this time the congress has released no details and keeping it vague makes sense because i find it hard to see how it can make economic sense depending on how they define poor how much income they offer and what the cost is the plan will either be ineffective or unworkable the modi government s interim budget announced a handout for poor farmers that seemed rather pointless given our agricultural distress offering a poor farmer bucks a month seems almost like mockery such condescending handouts solve nothing the poor want jobs and opportunities those come with growth which requires structural reforms structural reforms do not sound sexy as election promises handouts do a classic example is farm loan waivers we have reached a stage in our politics where every party has to promise them to assuage farmers who are a strong vote bank everywhere you cannot blame farmers for wanting them they are a necessary anaesthetic but no government has yet made a serious attempt at tackling of our agricultural crisis why is it that good politics in india is always bad economics let me put forth some possible reasons one voters tend to think in zero sum ways as if the pie is fixed and the only way to bring people out of poverty is to redistribute the truth is that trade is a positive sum game and nations can only be lifted out of poverty when the whole pie grows but this is unintuitive two indian politics revolves around identity and patronage the spoils of power are limited that is indeed a zero sum game so you are likely to vote for whoever can look after the interests of your in group rather than care about the economy as a whole three voters tend to stay uninformed for good reasons because of what public choice economists call rational ignorance a single vote is unlikely to make a difference in an election so why put in the effort to understand the nuances of economics and governance just ask what is in it for me and go with whatever seems to be the best answer four politicians have a short term horizon geared towards winning the next election a good policy that may take years to play out is unattractive a policy that will win them votes in the short term is preferable sadly no indian party has shown a willingness to aim for the long term the congress has produced new gandhis but not new ideas and while the bjp did make some solid promises in they did not walk that talk and have proved to be as arun shourie once called them upa cow even the congress is adopting the cow in fact so maybe the bjp will add temple to that mix benjamin franklin once said democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch this election season my friends the people of india are on the menu you have been deveined and deboned marinated with rhetoric seasoned with narrative now enter the oven and vote posted by amit varma on february in '],\n",
